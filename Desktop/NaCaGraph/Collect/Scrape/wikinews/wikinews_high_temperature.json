It uses very high-temperature electrolysis to separate hydrogen from water, so that hydrogen may be used for energy production. Electrolysis is one method by which laboratories and factories produce hydrogen. An electrical current is passed through water, breaking it down into hydrogen and oxygen gas, which are then collected above the water reservoir. Researchers in Salt Lake City, Utah, at Ceramtech Incorporated, in collaboration with workers at The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory report that when water is superheated to 800 degrees Celsius, far less electricity is required to produce the same volume of hydrogen. The researchers envision that future nuclear fission plants could be used both to heat the water as part of their cooling system, and generate the needed electricity. Concerns have been raised regarding the safety of such arrangements, however.  Jeremy Desterhoft, an independent consultant on nuclear energy safety, warns the \"elevated levels of radiation required to sufficiently lower the atomic separation point is beyond the current capabilities of any recent cooler.\"  He does not believe that economically viable cooling technology will be available for at least four to six more years."}, "6-4": {"heading": "Snow causes disruption in UK ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Snow_causes_disruption_in_UK", "date": "8-February-2007", "text": "Heavy snow has caused disruption in the United Kingdom with airports and schools closed and delays on the road network.

Embedded Journalist Darrin Mortenson, who was with U.S. troops during the operation in Fallujah, already reported in April 2004 that a mortar team leader \"directed his men to fire round after round of high explosives and white phosphorus charges into the city Friday and Saturday\". The U.S. State department initially denied that white phosphorus was used as weaponry, but Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Barry Venable said white phosphorous munitions were used as an incendiary weapon against enemy combatants. \"It was not used against civilians,\" he said in a Tuesday briefing. Lt. Col. Venable repeated U.S. State department statements that white phosphorous munitions are a standard field artillery element. Up until at least April 2001 it was \"against the law of land warfare to employ WP against personnel targets\" according to the U.S. Army Battle Book. The Pentagon briefing directed reporters to the March-April 2005 edition of the U.S. Army's Field Artillery magazine, where veterans of the Fallujah action described their use of white phosphorous munitions to \"flush [insurgents] out\", and it use as a screening agent (providing smoke cover) and as \"a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines.\" The 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons (Protocol III), which the USA is not a signatory to, disallows the use of incendiary weapons against civilian populations or air attacks against troops stationed in a civilian population center, but does not outlaw its battlefield use.

The Italian documentary showed photos of what it said were Iraqis who had been burned by the white phosphorous. The accepted lethal dose of white phosphorous is 1mg/kg. The smoke raises contentions for its battlefield use. It is primarily used as a \"marker\", as the high temperature combustion causes \"pillaring\" of the smoke column. But the smoke does contain phosphoric acid and traces of unburned phosphorous, which is corrosive to human tissue (internally and externally.)

The protests marked what would have been the 49th birthday of Lisa McPherson, who is claimed to be a victim of the Church of Scientology's practices. Lisa died in 1995 during a running of what Scientologists refer to as an Introspection Rundown, a procedure intended to help Church members deal with a psychotic or deeply traumatic event. Protests were planned throughout the day in 14 countries and over 50 different cities. The estimation of total protesters world wide for Feb. 10, 2008 is 9,250 people. Wikinews had correspondents at a number of protest locations to report on the events. This article was updated throughout the day with reports from around the globe. About 150 anonymous protesters turned out in Adelaide to protest the Church of Scientology. Most wore masks, many also wearing suits or wigs. 200+ members of Anonymous gathered in Atlanta.  While riot police were called to the scene as well as the local media, only one incident occurred.  A person from the Anonymous crowd tried to enter the church to talk to them but police temporarily detained him.  He was later released without charges. Correspondent: Craig Russell Correspondent: TUFKAAP Protesters in Boston covered all four corners of the block surrounding the Church with 30-45 people on each side of the streets and corners. Most protesters ranged from 18 to 25 years old. Crowds soon swelled to numbers of about 250. The weather was of typical New England weather, where it quickly jumped from sunny weather at the start to slight drizzling rain then to a downpour and eventually a flurry that lasted about 15\u201320 minutes before dissipating. However, even that did not drive the protesters away. The protesters' meet up spot was Trinity Church in Boston's famed Copley Square right under the gaze of the John Hancock Building. After congregating protesters proceeded down to the local Scientology church and began their picket. An ex-Scientology member know as Larry Brennan showed up and said he applauded what \"Anonymous\" was doing. Meanwhile, a camera watched the protest from the top floor of the Scientology church looking at the protesters gathered below. Throughout the protest, each corner took turns shouting this chant \"Religion! Should! Be! Free!\" At the same time, cars honked in support for the protesters, including firemen of the Boston Fire Department and the Boston Public Works Department road sanding crew, along with various taxis. Drivers were often encouraged to honk by the protesters. Protesters gave pamphlets and leaflets to cars, pedestrians, and police officers. According to the free daily BostonNOW, Rev. Gerard Renna of the Boston church referred to Anonymous as \"a group of cyber-terrorists ... perpetrating religious hate crimes.\" It is estimated that 200-250 people attended in total. Correspondent: Brian McNeil The Brussels protest organisers decided to take things one step further than the \"mask\" dress code - and introduce a formal dress code of \"Black, and Red Tie\". Saturday saw the start of press coverage for the event with Dutch-language national paper De Morgen devoting four columns in their reporter section to the protest and events that led up to it. Lisa McPherson, Tom Cruise, and John Sweeney were all covered along with images of the \"Anonymous\" advertising poster and the European Church of Scientology HQ in the Brussels city centre. The protesters met up at Parc Royal metro station about 1\u00a0km away from the European H.Q. of the Church of Scientology and spent approximately an hour putting finishing touches to placards and cutting up leaflets, all under the watchful eye of a number of suspected Scientology \"spies\" equipped with cameras and cellphones. Following closely the advice from police the group of approximately 30 marched to 91 Wetstraat where the Church H.Q. is in a subdued manner with banners and placards turned down. As the group marched to their point where a static protest was permitted three film crews from Belgian TV ran round filming the group and walking backwards to interview those who were prepared to speak to the press. Protesters came from as far afield as Luxembourg. The police presence for the protest was fairly light, upon arrival at the protest site, 91 Wetstraat (Rue De La Loi) one van and three officers were parked outside the Scientology HQ, approximately 15 minutes later two other police cars had turned up - delivering the Brussels Central chief of police and another four officers to monitor the protest. Instructions were given to protesters that they could not, under Belgian law, conceal their faces with masks, scarves or veils. The signs in use by the protesters included a large \"HONK!\" which whenever a passing motorist hit the horn roused a large cheer from the crowd. Others read \"Scientology kills\", \"Religion is free, Scientology is not\", \"XENU.NET\", \"All your Thetans are belong to us\", \"Hello Scientology, We are Anonymous\", and \"Alien souls inhabit you\". Some were crudely done handwriting, others had been made at the pre-protest meeting with stencils and spray paint. A chant was started early on, and repeated a few times throughout the day, \"Brainwash! Brainwash! Brainwash!\", this could likely be heard by people within the Church H.Q. as a number of upper floor windows were open. Leaflets were handed out to passers by and motorists as they stopped at the nearest set of traffic lights. While highlighting that Christianity, Judaism, and Islam will freely give you details about their religion Scientology was starkly contrasted as \"Ask a Scientologist about their texts, You will be answered. After your check clears\". The protest went off with no problems, although concern was expressed by some participants that they were not better allowed to conceal their identities. This was made extra concerning with the belief that some of those taking photos from a distance were members of the Church cataloguing the protesters. Correspondent: DragonFire1024 As many as 50 people turned up to protest the Church in cold weather and wind driven snow. With temperatures ranging from 10 to just 15 degrees Fahrenheit and winds at nearly 45 miles an hour, protesters held signs and braved Mother Nature. Some lost their signs in the wind a few times, but managed to swipe them back up before they got lost in the weather. Among the protesters attending was Chuck Beatty, a former Scientologist of 27 years from the Sea Org in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Several passing cars showed their support by honking, including a big red semi-truck tow truck. The police were on scene to make sure protesters followed laws, but they were off duty officers hired by the Church because they \"needed protection from Anonymous,\" said O. Casillas of the Buffalo police Department. Casillas also stated that protesters, \"according to New York state law\", had to be at least 100 feet from the Church, but because of a fence, protesters were allowed to picket across the street from the Church. Casillas also took a flier with the rules and regulations for protesters stating, \"I cannot take sides here, but the Church privately hired us.\" At least three members of the Church were seen photographing, videotaping, and counting anyone who was gathered outside the Church. The protesters were not approached by any members of the Church. Wikinews attempted to get a statement from the church, but Casillas stated that \"the Church knew what organization [I] was from\" and that \"Wikinews was not welcome there [at the Church].\" Wikinews recently published several stories and interviews that do not favor the Church and the officer's quotes suggest the Church is aware of those articles. See a gallery of images below, and or click on the 'Buffalo Photo Gallery' to see all the images. The Chicago protest against the Church began slightly before 11:00 a.m. (central time) and concluded at roughly 4:30 p.m.. Upwards of 70 protesters gathered in support of the protest. Though temperatures remained in the sub-zero range throughout the day (0 degrees Fahrenheit, -22 wind chill), spirits remained high. Participants handed out literature and held signs at the intersection of Lincoln, Wellington and Southport until roughly 2:00 p.m.. During that time, a nearby Catholic church dismissed, and numerous Church-goers welcomed the fliers. Protesters garnered a multitude of honks from supportive motorists. After 2:00 p.m., the large group splintered into multiple travelling squads which navigated the Lakeview and Lincoln Park neighbourhoods until 4:30 p.m.. Protesters had to follow legal restrictions and the Church conducted the Centre's counter-protest measures, such as blocking their windows and holding service from 11:00 a.m. straight through 6:00 p.m.. Approximately 200 people protested Scientology along Cleveland Street in Clearwater.  They were photographed by 20-year-old Scientologist David Pendery, who seemed to believe that it was \"unlawful to wear a mask and I wanted to document it.\"  The Church also hired ten police officers to monitor the protest. The protest was delayed by 30 minutes so the protesters would not interrupt a Presbyterian Church service. [4] More than 100 people picketed on a street corner in front of the Dallas Church of Scientology. Protestors held up signs with pictures of Lisa McPherson, who was a Dallas native. \"We want people to know we are raising awareness, and that is one of our main tools to fight Scientology,\" said one masked protestor. A few signs read \"Honk if you hate Scientology\", and some cars could be heard honking their horns as they passed by. Police were on the scene to ensure that the demonstration was peaceful. The Dallas Church of Scientology released a statement regarding the group Anonymous, which read, \"Using Scientology's prominence, Anonymous hopes to garner more attention ... Religious bigotry of any nature is deplorable and profoundly affects the entire community.\" Video from the event Around 50 to 140 people turned up at the Church of Scientology centre in Edinburgh to protest. As protesters were not allowed directly opposite the centre a small police presence was visible in order to control the crowd. Banners with \"Scientology Kills\" were placed at the front of the protesters and chants gradually began to start as the day progressed. Leaflets were handed out to members of the public passing by while people within the Church of Scientology were seen to be taking photographs from inside the church. Access to the church was restricted during the protest, but several protesters made comment to a reporter from the Scotsman newspaper. The Houston protest hosted an estimated 81 people.  Between 8 and 12 Houston police officers and staff were on site though, but stood and watched the protesters. There were no reports of significant confrontation, though scientologists and protesters took photographs of each other. A CW 39 cameraman was on site taking footage and conducting interviews.  Broadcast television reports of the protest were carried on KHOU CBS 11 and KHCW CW 39 later in the evening. Correspondents: Skenmy and Adambro The first London protest took place outside the Church of Scientology HQ in Queen Victoria Street. Upon arrival at 10:30, approximately 50 people were in attendance. This was complemented by a small team of police officers. Members of the Church of Scientology were handing out flyers outside the HQ, with the protesters on the other side of the road. Numerous members of the media, as well as tens of amateur photographers and videographers were in attendance. By 11:00, the number of protesters had grown to between 300 and 500. A variety of signs were on display, bearing such slogans as \"Ron is Gone but the Con goes On\" (referring to L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology) and \"$cientology Kills\" (referring to the claims that the Church of Scientology extorts money from its members). The police responded to this growth in numbers with riot vans, a large number of Community Support officers, and Police Horses, as well as a dog unit. The protest at Queen Victoria Street was peaceful. Members of Anonymous were respectful of Police orders. Inside the building, security officers could be seen. Members were seen videoing and photographing the protests from the upper windows of the HQ building, prompting responses from the crowd. Signs were held saying \"Honk if you hate Scientology\" - causing a cheer from the crowd every time a car used the horn. The infamous bright yellow \"/b/\" van was seen driving past early in the protest. At around 1:00 the protesters moved on towards Tottenham Court Road's \"Dianetics and Scientology Life Improvement Centre\", where the police presence was even higher, and crowd barriers were set up. Half of Tottenham Court Road was closed for the demonstration, so a single-file line of traffic was all that flowed between the protesters (of which a significant majority of the original number turned up) and the Church of Scientology building. Members of the Church of Scientology were handing out flyers, much like at Queen Victoria Street. However, the crowd this time shouted for passers-by to \"tear it up\" - some of whom did. Police reacted to those tearing up the material and throwing it down with the issue of a littering ticket. This road was much busier than the previous one, and a large crowd gathered to look. The crowd could be heard shouting \"It's a trap!\" when members of the public were offered free Stress Tests by the members of the Church of Scientology. There were a number of minor incidents involving protesters (who were quickly distanced by the majority crowd), but no major violations took place. Estimates by Anonymous for the total numbers at the event range from 300 to 800 people, however the BBC and City of London Police report 200 people at the event. Correspondent: IlyaHaykinson At least 250 people attended the anti-Scientology protest in Los Angeles, California.  The protesters gathered in the morning at a central location and proceeded by subway to the site of the first protest, the Church of Scientology - Los Angeles.  For nearly two hours the protesters chanted \"We are Anonymous\" and other slogans, and responded with yells and upheaval to honking cars that were passing by.  The protest spread over two city blocks, and at one point the entire group of protesters circled the city block containing various Scientology buildings. The protest then proceeded via subway to the Church of Scientology International building in Hollywood.  There the protesters continued chanting, and marched up and down the street.  A group of protesters unfurled a banner in sympathy with the death of Lisa McPherson, and the crowd sang the happy birthday song for her. The protest continued for an additional couple of hours as the crowd moved to a former Scientology recruiting building and then to the street level of a major mall and tourist attraction, Hollywood & Highland. After losing quite a few members the protest moved on to the front of the CNN building in hope of getting on news. Security was high at all Scientology installations, with security officers blocking all entrances to Church buildings, patrolling on foot and bicycle, and most taking pictures or videos of protesters (or even the Wikinews reporter).  No police intervention was observed, though at least one or two officers were present at most times. Correspondent: Fallen-Griever A protest in Manchester took place outside the Church of Scientology centre located on Deansgate, with around 100 people protesting at its peak. The protest was peaceful, with the protesters mainly sticking to waving banners and handing out flyers to passers-by. Protesters respected a request from the police that they should leave the area by 3pm in order to avoid blocking the area for patrons leaving the multiple bars along Deansgate at the end of the Manchester Derby (a football match between Manchester United and Manchester City). There was a minimal police presence at the event and the Church of Scientology centre was closed by the end of the protest. In a video posted on YouTube, at least 75 to 100 protesters can be heard chanting \"Xenu, Xenu, Xenu\" as they protest across the street from the Church. Cars driving by honk their horns in support of the protesters. Police can be seen parked in front of the Church.

The group ranged from 10 to 25+, with public response mostly positive. The Scientology protest in New Orleans took place at 11:00am CST. There were 19 members of Anonymous that showed up to protest. Everything went smoothly. One police officer stopped by just to make sure that the crowd was demonstrating peacefully. Many pictures and video was taken by the assembled group as well as pictures being taken by the few Scientologists that showed up. One large woman drove incredibly fast to park behind the Scientology building at one point (the church was closed before some protesters arrived) and nearly hit two protesters. She was later spotted snapping countless pictures from the second floor. Over the course of the protests, about 5 cars ended up parked behind the building. One bald man came out to attempt to harass some protesters and was labeled a \"Level 12 Paladin\". He left soon after. Eventually the two most interesting subjects of the Church of Scientology appeared, and were initially perceived as standard passerby's. When offered fliers the couple spat \"What have you done?\" and \"What are your crimes?\" at the protesters. One donned a Scientology vest and stood in front of the building, while his minion walked around taking pictures 5 inches from their faces. There was some sparse foot traffic in the area and handouts were given to people passing by. A woman stopped by to talk to some Anonymous and stated that she had a family member who was trying to leave the CoS and was glad for the protests. A man in a truck parked and got some fliers, promising to return. About an hour later he arrived, wearing sunglasses and armed with a homemade sign, and joined the group. An employee of the local newspaper, The Times Picayune, stopped to speak with Anonymous for a little while. He stated that he was in the area on another story but was interested in finding out information about the protest. The Anonymous answered his questions, gave him handouts, but refused to share any personal contact information with him. Near the end of the protest the two Scientologists decided to walk off. Correspondent(s): David Shankbone An estimated 150 people separated into two primary groups protested the Church of Scientology in Philadelphia. Protests began in the area surrounding City Hall, eventually culminating around the Church located on Race Street. Pedestrian foot traffic was high due to a major event at the Convention Center. A police officer on the scene described the gathering as \"the friendliest [protesters] I've ever seen.\" Correspondent: Bjweeks Approximately 60 people showed up to protest in front of the Scientology church in Phoenix, many wearing purple latex gloves and dressed in black suits. Three Phoenix Police Department officers were present to keep control. CBS 5, Fox 10, NBC 12, The Arizona Republic and The East Valley Tribune came to interview the protesters and  The Church of Scientology held a press conference where the official press release was read and no comments were made about the Phoenix protest. The protesters read high level Scientology teaching that had been made public to Scientologists during the press conference and later in the day, with little visible success. Correspondent: Dar-Ape Several dozen protesters arrived across the street from the Scientology bookstore in South Side to protest, carrying signs and handing out flyers.  Protesters included many students, mostly hailing from Pitt and CMU.  Cars honked in support, though pedestrian traffic was a bit more sparse.  Two or three police officers kept an eye on protesters from inside the bookstore, but everything went smoothly. As the high for the day was twenty degrees and with wind chill making it feel as though the temperatures were in the sub zeros; the anons cut their protest to only about four hours. One Pittsburgh Anon's Photos Images were emailed to Wikinews. The protest in Portland seemed to have had a leader (or leader-like figure) or two, and was lawful and very well organized. There was always yelling, sometimes intense, whenever someone entered the church. Some who entered did so smiling defiantly, some were hesitant and looked noticeably distressed. Loud cheering erupted every time a passing by car honked (estimated 1 out of 5), this included even a Trimet bus. 8 people showed up and picketed in front of City Hall on the 2/10/2008. The reason why City Hall and not the traditional Church of Scientology is because San Antonio does not have a Scientology chapter. This being the reason many of the protesters of San Antonio went to Austin to support their cause. The protesters handed out fliers and held up informational posters and a \"honk if you hate Scientology\" poster. Many of the cars honked including but not limited to the Via bus system, SAPD, SAFD, and churchgoers. San Antonio Videos: [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] San Diego drew about 80 protesters, starting an hour later than most of the other worldwide protests. The group started at the Horton Plaza shopping mall, and then moved on to the Church of Scientology building. After demonstrating there, the group moved back to the shopping mall, positioning itself on eight street corners, handing out information, flyers, and speaking with concerned bystanders. Not one, but two protesters dressed up as Xenu. When 10 News showed up to cover the event, they refused to do an interview unless they could speak with a protester face to face. When none of the protesters agreed to this condition, a compromise was reached. A protester gave an audio interview for the station to use when putting together information about the protest. After several protesters left, the protest moved back to the Church. Police presence was constant, but at the time of dispersal at the end of the protest several members reported being followed by Scientologists. San Diego Videos: More pics A worldwide day of protests against the Church of Scientology has begun in Sydney after an agglomeration of protesters at 11am in Hyde Park. A crowd of about 200 turned out to protest against the Church and its alleged violations of human rights. The group Anonymous, who organized the rally, were handing out fliers to passers-by, and led various anti-Scientology chants by the crowd. The principal allegations made at the rally towards Scientology were the lack of freedom within the Church, and the excessive cost of their courses, which they believe doesn't warrant tax-exempt status. The Protest lasted until 1pm at the Church of Scientology Office in Town Hall and from there partially disbanded. The remaining protesters proceeded to the Scientology office in Broadway and started a lesser secondary protest lasting about 25 minutes. The Toronto protest kicked off at 11:30 a.m. (EST). At least 300 attended the protest for the afternoon. Despite the wind chill of -22 at 11:00 and declining temperatures throughout the day, the protest was still robust at 2:00. The crowd later tapered down to fewer than 10 by 6:00 p.m.. One protester possessed a cap gun, however other protesters in his vicinity quickly pointed him out to the police, who confiscated it without charge. A Church member was seen throwing rock salt at some protesters for a short period of time, but later went back into the Church. Generally, the protest was peaceful and picketers were well behaved overall. Police allowed protesters to stand right outside the Scientology building. There were many people attempting to record the event with cameras, video cameras, and/or microphones, and several picketers were interviewed. The chants sometimes included \"Xenu!\", which left some passersby confused about whether the protest was for or against Scientology. However, the public was generally receptive to the protesters' message, particularly earlier in the day. Many cars passing by, especially taxis, honked in support, as did a fire truck and an ambulance. Most people offered flyers during the first couple of hours took them, though later on people seemed to grow tired of them. It was an enthusiastic, successful protest. Over 200 people showed up and passed out pamphlets, chanted slogans, and covered the entire block at one point. Scientologists tried to counter-protest by unfurling a \"Scientology For Peace\" banner at one point, but protesters with signs blocked the banner from view. After 30 minutes, the Church took down their banner. People from all over the area came to support the protest. Vancouver Police sent a single cruiser on scene to monitor the situation, but after an hour it left without incident. Another moment that should be noted is how after the crowd of protesters swelled from 20-200 participants within an hour, A van pulled up in the rear of the building where no protester was then present. Some people took notice and went down to investigate. What they saw was a number of church members piling boxes of documents and entire filing cabinets into the van. They then soon drove off with it. There were pictures taken of the van. It was as if they anticipated a break-in to their office where demonstrators could've seize documentation. Church members, some in plain clothes and some wearing Church uniforms, videotaped protesters, tried to mingle with the protesters to disrupt the protest from within, and followed protesters away from the protest when they left. About 20 people protested in front of the Scientology Center in Capistrangasse in Vienna's 6th district. At 12:30, half an hour after the demonstration started, individuals claiming to be At least 30 people showed up to protest the Church in Winnipeg. The temperature in Winnipeg on February 10 was -50 C with the wind chill. Project Chanology states that people held signs stating, \"Scientology destroys families, Why is [Lisa McPherson] dead?\" and even \"Honk if you think Scientology is a cult.\" Correspondents:Anonymous101 Although there was no official protest on the internet, thousands of people supported Anonymous by subscribing to the channel on the online video sharing site YouTube, where the numbers for the channel have doubled in 24 hours, making it the most subscribed channel on YouTube this month.

The blaze reportedly started with a parked Range Rover Discovery. Investigators with the fire brigade stated that they believe the fire began with an accidental engine fire in the Range Rover at about 4.30 pm. The first call was made at 4.42 and firefighters arrived eight minutes after that. Ultimately twelve engines and 85 firefighters were involved in combatting the blaze. Aerial appliances were used and also three high-volume pumps. Fed by the fuel in vehicles parked inside, the temperature of the fire in the carpark is believed to have reached as high as 1,000\u00b0C. It was too hot to be extinguished with water from hydrants, so a high-volume pump was used to draw water from the River Mersey, and two more were brought from other fire brigades in the region. The carpark has seven storeys and a capacity of 1,600 vehicles, and approximately 1,300  were parked in it when the fire broke out. According to Dan Stephens, chief fire officer for Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service, almost all of them were destroyed, with the exception of a few parked on the top level and at corners. \"With these very high temperatures, you were never going to put the fire out without the whole building taking hold. The speed at which the fire spreads means you simply aren\u2019t going to put it out,\" said Stephens. The carpark itself was severely damaged; according to Joe Anderson, the mayor of Liverpool. It is not in danger of collapsing but will have to be demolished, which will be difficult with the many burned-out cars still inside it, Anderson told the BBC. According to Stephens, there were no serious injuries: one woman injured her hand, and two people were treated for smoke inhalation. A spokesman for the Echo Arena also stated that all animals were safe. All horses were successfully evacuated from the carpark and then removed from the stables after smoke spread to them. Six dogs were also rescued unharmed, two on a lower level in the early stages of the fire and four that had been left in a car on the top level, freed by firefighters on Monday after the fire was put out. The final evening of the four-day Liverpool International Horse Show had been scheduled to begin at 7.30, and had to be cancelled. Many attendees were stranded in the city on New Year's Eve night. Merseyside police directed people to the Pullman Hotel, where Red Cross assistance was available, and the Liverpool City Council set up an assistance centre at the Lifestyles Gym. A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers has said that insurance companies will \"move very quickly\" to reimburse owners whose vehicles were destroyed. Nearby blocks of flats were evacuated because of the smoke. Eyewitnesses reported hearing what they at first thought were firecrackers, then \"multiple explosions\", \"bangs and popping\", \"the bangs of car windows exploding\". People reported leaving everything in their cars, including their cellphones, and running for their lives. Mayor Anderson tweeted that cuts to fire services over the last two years made it significantly harder to fight the fire and might have caused it not to be controllable.

Officials estimate that number could grow as other counties report in. According to Tim Reimer of the United States Farm Service Agency, cattle nearing slaughter are difficult to keep cool due to their large size, and thus more vulnerable to heat. The animals are provided large quantities of water, but they sometimes stop drinking under the effects of the high temperatures. The deaths worsened the situation for farmers, who were already struggling with high feed costs. \"There were some that took some pretty substantial hits financially\", Reimer said. Temperatures in eastern portions of the state soared into the mid 90s. The heat wave was preceded by an unusually cool spring, so the animals didn't have a chance to acclimatise. Terry Mader, a professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, reported that \"Cattle, as well as other animals and humans, usually need two to four weeks to adapt to the changes in environmental conditions we observed last week. Sunny days with temperatures above the mid-80s can be stressful, particularly if there is no wind and humidity is above 50%.\" Similar heat waves occurred during the 1990s, when thousands of cattle were lost.

The report, which focuses on the United States, warned consequences of climate change are increasing across the country. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere has exceeded 400 parts per million. The last time this level was reached was approximately three million years ago. NCA4 Volume 1, entitled \"Climate Science Special Report\" (CSSR), was released late last year, and Volume 2, entitled \"Impacts, Risks, and Adaptation in the United States\", on Friday. NCA4 is part of an ongoing series of NCA stand-alone reports updating the state of science on climate change and its potential physical impacts on the regions of the United States. The the third report was released in 2014. Changes in the United States highlighted in the report include worsening and more frequent landfalling atmospheric rivers \u2014 bands of rain-laden air in the sky. These rivers of water vapor tend to be around 300 miles (500 km) wide, carrying something like 25 times the water volume of the Mississippi River. They can cause extreme precipitation events and flooding. NCA4 also reported on increasing wildfires, such as the record California wildfires, high temperature extremes, retreating glaciers, and melting snow cover, the decline of sea ice, rising sea levels with increasing ocean acidification and coastal flooding. It describes how climate change would reportedly impact the US economy and quality of life if effective action is not taken to address climate change. The report says by the end of the 21st century, the United States economy may face a roughly ten percent loss of GDP.

In the past 50 years, temperatures in the Baltic Sea have risen causing oxygen levels in the water to decrease. A study was performed on shallow-water eelpouts, a fish with a large head which looks much like an eel, that showed that the creatures required more oxygen. With the decreased levels of oxygen, the eelpouts are literally gasping for air and causing the number of eelpouts to decrease. \"When you say I get less oxygen in, then I have less oxygen available for aerobic energy and I have less energy for the diverse tasks that a species needs to fulfill in an ecosystem, such as being ready to prey, grow, move and reproduce. It's a general weakening of the individual once it is going beyond its thermal limitation\", said Hans P\u00f6rtner, an animal physiologist and ecologist. Although the study only focused on the eelpouts, scientists say that the problem affects all fish and overfishing could occur. \"There is relatively strong evidence that the cod in the North Sea find it too warm to maintain high productivity. When the fishing industry maintains the same high fishing pressure\u2014that has not been a problem before\u2014with the lower productivity, this turns into overfishing,\" added P\u00f6rtner. Scientists also state that the declining numbers in the eelpouts and fish does not mean that they will become extinct. \"It doesn't mean that the species will go extinct necessarily, but it means they will move. If temperatures are going to change in [the] future, then it will have a major impact on the distribution of animals,\" said a zoophysiologist at the University of Aarhus in Denmark, Tobias Wang.

Climate models predicted more greenhouse gases would weaken the equatorial Pacific trade winds. While previous research supposed natural variability alone accounted for cooling in the eastern Pacific, this study highlights a previously overlooked climate feedback: as the Atlantic warms, it alters the winds over the Pacific, depressing the ocean temperature there. Coauthor Malte Stuecker of the University of Hawaii Meteorology Department reports that \"Our study documents that some of the largest tropical and subtropical climate trends of the past 20 years are all linked: Strengthening of the Pacific trade winds, acceleration of sea level rise [three times faster than the global average] in the western Pacific, eastern Pacific surface cooling, the global warming hiatus, and even the massive droughts in California\". His colleague cauthor Fei-Fei Jin adds, \"We are just starting to grasp the scope of the impacts of this global atmospheric reorganization and of the out-of phase temperature trends in the Atlantic and Pacific regions\". Coauthor Axel Timmermann of the University of Hawaii notes a further amplifying effect: \"Stronger trade winds in the equatorial Pacific also increase the upwelling of cold waters to the surface. The resulting near-surface cooling in the eastern Pacific amplifies the Atlantic\u2013Pacific pressure seesaw, thus further intensifying the trade winds [...] It turns out that the current generation of climate models underestimates the extent of the Atlantic\u2013Pacific coupling, which means that they cannot properly capture the observed eastern Pacific cooling, which has contributed significantly to the leveling off, or the hiatus, in global warming.\""}, "6-29": {"heading": "Astronomers find water vapour in atmosphere of exoplanet K2-18b ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Astronomers_find_water_vapour_in_atmosphere_of_exoplanet_K2-18b", "date": "14-September-2019", "text": "In findings published Tuesday in Cornell University's arXiv by a team of scientists from the University of Montreal and a separate report published Wednesday in Nature Astronomy by a team from University College London (UCL), the presence of water vapour was confirmed in the atmosphere of K2-18b, a planet circling a star in the constellation Leo.  This is the first such discovery in a planet in its star's habitable zone \u2014 not too hot and not too cold for liquid water to exist. The Montreal team, led by Bj\u00f6rn Benneke, used data from the NASA's Hubble telescope to assess changes in the light coming from K2-18b's star as the planet passed between it and Earth.  They found that certain wavelengths of light, which are usually absorbed by water, weakened when the planet was in the way, indicating not only does K2-18b have an atmosphere, but the atmosphere contains water in vapour form.  The team from UCL then analyzed the Montreal team's data using their own software and confirmed their conclusion. This was not the first time scientists have found signs of water on an exoplanet, but previous discoveries were made on planets with high temperatures or other pronounced differences from Earth. \"This is the first potentially habitable planet where the temperature is right and where we now know there is water,\" said UCL astronomer Angelos Tsiaras. \"It's the best candidate for habitability right now.\" \"It's a good sign\", said Ryan Cloutier of the Harvard\u2013Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, who was not one of either study's authors. \"Overall,\" he continued, \"the presence of water in its atmosphere certainly improves the prospect of K2-18b being a potentially habitable planet, but further observations will be required to say for sure.\" K2-18b was first identified in 2015 by the Kepler space telescope.

She said this incident was her first visit to a Wendy's restaurant. Ayala described how she found the finger, \"Suddenly something crunchy was in my mouth,\" she continued, \"and I spit it out.\" According to Devina Cordero, 20, after Ayala found the finger, she ran up to her and Cordero's boyfriend and said, \"Don't eat it! Look, there's a human finger in our chili.\" \"We went up to the counter and they told us it was a vegetable,\" Cordero continued. \"The people from Wendy's were poking it with a spoon.\" The restaurant is located at 1405 Monterey Highway, just south of downtown San Jose. Wikinews reporter David Vasquez drove his car up to the drive-thru menu and found that chili was still on the menu, at a price of US$1.19 for a small serving. He also witnessed workers unloading supplies from a semi-trailer truck in the restaurant's parking lot, and carting them into the back door of the establishment. According to Ben Gale, director of environmental health for Santa Clara County, the finger did not come from any of the employees at the restaurant. \"We asked everybody to show us they have 10 fingers and everything is OK there,\" he said. The found portion of the finger likely belonged to a woman because of its long and manicured fingernail, also found in the food. Officials seized the food supply at the restaurant and are tracing it back to the manufacturer, where they believe the finger may have gotten mixed in with the raw ingredients used to prepare the chili. The restaurant's operators were later permitted to re-open after preparing new chili prepared from fresh ingredients. As this story was filed, there was no mention of the incident on the Wendy's corporate web site. Wendy's issued a statement through a spokesman. \"Food safety is of utmost importance to us,\" said Wendy's spokesman Joe Desmond.

The report suggests that the world's deserts face dramatic changes as a result of global climate change: high water demands, tourism and salt contamination of irrigated soils. Desert margins and mountainous areas within deserts that have been important for people, wildlife and water supplies for millennia, are under particular threat, say UNEP. 2006 is the United Nations' International Year of Deserts and Desertification. Yet deserts could become the \"carbon-free power houses of the 21st century,\" some experts believe. They argue an area 800 by 800 km of desert, such as the Sahara, could capture the solar energy to generate all the world's electricity needs - and more. The report, prepared by experts from across the globe, flags options that may help governments and relevant bodies deliver a more sustainable future for the Earth's desert regions. \"There are many popular and sometimes misplaced views of deserts which this report either confirms or overturns. Far from being barren wastelands, they emerge as biologically, economically and culturally dynamic while being increasingly subject to the impacts and pressures of the modern world,\" said Shafqat Kakakhel, UNEP's Officer in Charge and Deputy Executive Director. \"If the huge, solar-power potential of deserts can be economically harnessed the world has a future free from fossil fuels. And tourism based around desert nature can, if sensitively managed, deliver new prospects and perspectives for people in some of the poorest parts of the world,\" said Mr Kakakhel. Almost one-quarter of the earth's land surface \u2013 some 33.7 million square kilometres \u2013 has been defined as \"desert\" in some sense. These deserts are inhabited by over 500 million people, significantly more than previously thought. In many parts of the world desert cores remain pristine, representing some of the planet's \"last remaining areas of total wilderness,\" stated the UNEP in a news release. Desert species are on the brink of extinction the Global Deserts Outlook reports. At risk animals include various species of Gazelle, Oryx, Addax, Arabian Tahr and the Barbary sheep as well as one of the falconers favourite prey, the Houbara. \"At greatest risk are the few patches of dry woodlands associated with desert mountain habitats which may decline by up to 3.5 per cent per year,\" said the study. As a result of their valuable water supplies being diverted to domestic or agricultural use, desert wetlands, fed by the large rivers crossing deserts, are probably the most threatened ecosystem. Probable impacts include those created by roads, settlement expansion and other infrastructure developments around areas of desert montane. By 2050 the report estimates that  desert wilderness - those areas where there are no nearby roads - will decline from just under 60 per cent of the current total desert area to just over 30 per cent. The pharmaceutical potential of desert plants has yet to be tapped, suggests the report. Scientists across the globe are analysing many desert plants for potential medicinal compounds - including anti-cancer and anti-malarial substances, antioxidants, as well as appetite suppressants. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), who advise governments and the United Nations, have reported that temperatures in deserts could rise by an average of as much as five to seven degrees by 2100. The problem, UNEP say, will almost certainly be compounded by the melting of glaciers - whose waters sustain many deserts. The impacts of climate change include the transformation of semi-arid rangelands into deserts, UNEP reports. They say water supplies are under threat from salinization and pollution by pesticides and herbicides, and that rising water tables beneath irrigated soils has led to more salinization of soils. In some coastal areas ground-water supplies have been contaminated as seawater invades subsurface waters, the report shows. Large rivers that run through deserts have supported desert people for millennia, but many have been dammed, with water loss downstream having led to serious impacts on flood plains and river ecology."}, "6-39": {"heading": "US VX nerve gas disposal test a success ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/US_VX_nerve_gas_disposal_test_a_success", "date": "9-May-2005", "text": "Workers at Newport Chemical Depot in Indiana have completed a successful test-run of a chemical reactor designed to dispose of Cold War stockpiles of VX nerve agent.

Extremely high temperatures are used to turn the waste into a mildly radioactive glass-like substance, which can be used as a building material.  The process also releases an extremely hot mixture of gases that can be used to power steam turbines, generating electricity. The company claims that 70% of this electricity is used to drive the PGM process, while 30% is available as exportable energy. The solid waste produced by PGM is resistant to leeching, so there is little danger of radiation contaminating water supplies. However, it remains to be seen how openly companies will accept the use of mildly radioactive slag as a building material, even for use as a road bed filler. The waste gases (hydrogen gas, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, nitrogen gas, and various hydrocarbons) are produced by pyrolysis of organic substances in the input waste, and are therefore mainly harmless. If they were instead burned in the presence of oxygen, many of the usual pollutants would be produced, such as nitrogen dioxide and dioxin.

One of them resulted in British Airways Flight 38 crashing short of the runway at London's Heathrow Airport last year. The NTSB and the AAIB want Rolls-Royce to redesign the engines. Both events occurred on Boeing 777-200ER airplanes powered by Rolls-Royce RB211 Trent 800 Series engines. On January 17, 2008 British Airways Flight 38 experienced a dual engine rollback (reduction of engine power) on final approach to Heathrow and crashed, leaving one passenger seriously injured, eight passengers and four of the flight crew with minor injuries and the airplane written off. The second event occurred on November 26, 2008, when a Delta Air Lines Boeing 777 experienced a single engine rollback during cruise flight over Montana, United States while en route from Shanghai to Atlanta. Normal operations resumed after the flight crew followed Boeing's published procedure to recover engine performance and the airplane landed safely in Atlanta. Boeing has already developed new procedures after the crash to prevent ice from building up within their 777 fuel systems after it became apparent that icing may have been a factor, and it was some of these that the Delta flight crew had followed. Boeing modified these further after the Delta incident. As part of the recent releases by the NTSB and AAIB it has become apparent that investigators from both bodies, which are collaborating, have found ice buildup in the fuel system caused both rollbacks. In both cases a build-up of ice (from water normally present in all jet fuel) developed on a component called the fuel/oil heat exchanger. This restricted the flow of fuel to the engine, resulting in the uncommanded engine rollback. Investigators initially struggled to produce enough ice under test conditions but have now found that at high concentration, fuel can form ice at very low temperatures in enough quantity to seriously restrict fuel flow, according to a new interim report by the AAIB. This does not occur when fuel demand is lower, as the hot oil then becomes sufficient to entirely melt the ice. The British jet experienced very low temperatures over Siberia. The vigorous tests are thought to be the first of their kind. They have also confirmed that while ice may have formed elsewhere in the airliner's fuel system fuel was probably not restricted at any other location. Instead, it is thought 'soft' ice formed in the pipes and then broke off, travelling to the fuel/oil heat exchanger and restricting it. The NTSB has now revealed that they have advised Rolls-Royce to redesign the fuel/oil heat exchanger, and Rolls-Royce have stated that they are indeed working on a replacement part that will be available within twelve months. The AAIB advised Boeing and Rolls-Royce to jointly review the problem across the fuel system, and both companies responded that they 'accepted' this recommendation and repeated that a replacement part was being developed. Both the NTSB and the AAIB also sent letters to the US Federal Aviation Administration and the European Aviation Safety Agency requesting the installment of the modified component be mandatory. The NTSB suggested this should be either the next maintenance check or within six months. There are 220 Boeing 777-200s - the only type using the affected engine - with Trent 800 series engines. The fuel/oil heat exchanger is a dual purpose part designed to simultaneously melt fuel ice and cool down engine oil. The AAIB further noted that it is unclear weather other aircraft designs are at risk, and advised the FAA and EASA to look into increased use of de-icing additives and investigate both the accumulation and sudden movement of ice in aircraft fuel systems and the actual formation of ice in the fuel itself."}, "6-42": {"heading": "2008 Winter Carnival partially thaws in Saint Paul ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/2008_Winter_Carnival_partially_thaws_in_Saint_Paul", "date": "30-January-2008", "text": "The Saint Paul Winter Carnival in Saint Paul, Minnesota suffered a brief thaw on Monday, with Monday's 41\u00b0F afternoon temperature plummeting below zero twenty four hours later.

The research confirms that the silk protein used for the egg case is different than that used in spider webs. Spider silks are renowned for their superior material properties, being among the toughest known natural Until now, the sequence of the silk protein used to construct the egg case was unknown. The team characterized the egg case silk protein from multiple spider species and found within a species its gene was composed of nearly identical, repeating sequences. The repeat units were also similar across species that diverged more than 125 million years ago. Their findings suggest that the egg case silk gene has been undergoing what is known as concerted evolution where mutations in one part of the gene \"spread\" to other parts of the same gene, creating a highly repetitive gene sequence. \"The protein of the egg-case fibers has a different function altogether from that of the other silks such as dragline or capture silks,\" Garb said. \"Egg-case silk has to last a long time and therefore must be durable under a wide variety of conditions, from freezing to very high temperatures. It needs to be strong enough to protect the eggs from threats such as predators, parasites and molds.\" Although the egg case silk protein is extremely different, its gene sequence shares certain features in common with all other spider silk genes. According to Garb, this discovery confirms that spider silk genes comprise what is known as a \"gene family\". This means that silk genes first evolved with spiders approximately 400 million years ago and subsequently evolved into different genes specifically used for different functions, such as genes for spider webs or genes for egg cases (Gatesy et al. 2001).  The researchers also suggest that there are many more silk genes that remain unknown, particularly as there are more than 37,000 known species of spiders, and silk genes sequences have been described from only a few species. According to the team, this unknown diversity of silk genes may not only be important for understanding spider evolution but also for the development of genetically modified fibers. \"Collectively, spider silks are some of the toughest natural fibers known,\" Hayashi said.  \"Imagine a fabric made from such a substance? It would be incredibly strong, flexible and ultimately, biodegradable.\""}, "6-45": {"heading": "Heatwave sweeps USA, many struggling to keep cool ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Heatwave_sweeps_USA,_many_struggling_to_keep_cool", "date": "18-July-2006", "text": "Temperatures as high as 111\u00b0F (48\u00b0C) have hit the United States today, a continuation of Monday's triple-digit (Fahrenheit) record highs in some areas.

The Posidonia australis is thought to have begun to clone itself 4,500 years ago, and covers about 200 square kilometres (77 square miles). It is located in Shark Bay, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in Western Australia. Shark Bay was submerged relatively recently, within the past 8,500 years. The scientists discovered the plant was a single organism after taking 18,000 separate genetic markers to examine the seagrass to find samples to use in restoration projects. However, they discovered the same plant had cloned itself many times instead. Dr Martin Breed, an ecologist at Flinders University, said \u201cWe thought 'what the hell is going on here?'... We were completely stumped.\" Jane Edgeloe, one of the co-authors of the research, said the DNA of the samples was compared and it was discovered from this that the seagrass meadow was a single plant. The plant is around three times the size of Manhattan, and measures at least 180 kilometres (112 miles) in length. As well as being the world's largest known plant, it is the world's largest known clone. The seagrass greatly surpasses the 43-hectare stand of quaking Aspen trees in Utah, United States, previously thought to be the world's largest plant. The seagrass grows a maximum of 35 centimetres per year, with its large size helping scientists calculate its age. Dr. Elizabeth Sinclair, another co-author of the study, said the plant's survival was helped by it holding onto all the chromosomes from both its parents. This gave it genetic diversity, which is unusual among plants that produce asexually. The plant does not sexually reproduce; however, subtle variations in its DNA may help explain its longevity. Associate Professor Kathryn McMahon, of Edith Cowan University, was not involved in the study but is an expert on seagrass. She said seagrass tends to live for between 2,000 and 100,000 years, meaning the plant's age of about 4,500 years fits into the normal age range of seagrass. McMahon also said she was confident in the method used by the researchers, and that the finding it was a single plant was \"amazing\". Despite the plant's vast size, in the past ten years, almost a tenth of it has been destroyed by cyclones and rising ocean temperatures, which NBC News noted had been attributed to climate change.

The first bomb to detonate was on the Liverpool Street train soon after it left for Aldgate on the Circle line, seconds before the others. The blast tripped out the power system, visible in the control room. The first call the police received that morning reported \"a bang\" at Aldgate East, coming within a minute of the blast. The Edgware Road train, leaving for Paddington and also on the Circle, exploded opposite a train coming from the other direction, making people think at first that it was a derailment. The first call to the Police spoke not of an explosion, but of a person falling under the wheels of the train. The confirmation of a bomb did not come until 9.17am, but by that time the emergency services were already on scene. Transport for London's new TrackerNet software is fully opertational on the Circle line, which allows for precise tracking of trains, but is not yet fully installed on the Piccadilly line. The first indication of the Piccadilly line bomb was when the tunnel telephone system wires were cut by the blast, an event logged by other software. The cutting of the lines then tripped out the track current. The tunnel itself suffered only slight damage and is safe, but the train - which was packed with commuters heading for Russell Square - is very badly damaged. London Underground declared a 'code Amber' within minutes, moving trains to platforms and opening all doors. A 'code Red' - full evacuation - was set at around 9.15am. O'Toole described the decision to evacuate as being \"very grave, not taken lightly\". When questioned as to whether everything possible had been done on the day to save lives, the managing director of Transport for London was \"very proud\" of the choices made that morning. As investigations continue, all bodies have been removed from the sub-surface Circle line trains, but the carriages themselves are still in situ while a painstaking forensic investigation takes place. Currently, work is on-going to retrieve bodies and forensic evidence from the carriage of the train in the deep tunnel of the Piccadilly line near King's Cross. Teams of rescue workers looking for human remains are working alongside forensics experts in a \"meticulous\" search to find evidence. Conditions are described as being very difficult, with high temperatures and lots of dust. Work was halted over Friday night when conditions became too bad, and resumed this morning.

Mary-Louise McLaws, a researcher at the University of NSW, said that the research found that most staff only washed their hands after using the toilet or when they felt dirty. Professor McLaws said healthcare workers should wash their hands after coming into contact with each and every patient. Even after simple tasks such as taking a patient's temperature and making a bed, healthcare workers should wash their hands according to the study. Researchers explained that despite more sinks being placed in hospitals, infection rates were still high. They concluded that behaviour modification was also required.

A large amount of  helium, which is used to cool the magnets to 1.9 Kelvin (-271C; -456F) leaked into the collider tunnel. LHC will now be shut down for at least two months for repairs. Physicists say such setbacks are an inevitable part of starting up such a large and complicated machine. Several mishaps, including the failure of a 30 ton  electrical transformer, have slowed LHC's progress since the initial start-up on September 10, 2008. The laboratory said in a statement that an electrical connection between the magnets had melted because of the high current. The machine has more than 1,200  dipole magnets arranged end-to-end in the underground ring. These magnets carry and steer the  proton beams which will accelerate around the machine at close to the speed of light. One of the LHC's eight sectors will now have to be warmed up to well above its operating temperature so that repairs can take place. The collider is designed to accelerate protons to energies of seven trillion  electron volts and collide them together in search of new particles and forces. After the initial success of accelerating protons through the machine, physicists had hoped they could move ahead quickly to low energy collisions at 450 billion electron volts and then 5 trillion electron volt collisions as early as mid-October. The recent setbacks, however, mean that hopes the first trial collisions would be carried out before the machine's official inauguration on October 21, 2008 now look doubtful.

Scientists say that the heat source producing the geysers is \"organic\" and that the material used to spew them is caused by the decaying of radioactive material from inside the moon. \"Deep inside Enceladus, our model indicates we've got an organic brew, a heat source and liquid water, all key ingredients for life. And while no one is claiming that we have found life by any means, we probably have evidence for a place that might be hospitable to life,\" said Dennis Matson, a scientist for the Cassini project. In a new model created by NASA scientists, data shows that Enceladus might have been created by aluminum and iron isotopes which have begun to decay causing large amounts of heat to build up in the moon and over billions of years later, the icy mass has began to melt near the moon's core, causing the water to spew into outer space. \"Enceladus is a very small body, and it's made almost entirely of ice and rock. The puzzle is how the moon developed a warm core. The only way to achieve such high temperatures at Enceladus is through the very rapid decay of some radioactive species,\" said Dr. Julie Castillo, the lead scientist developing the new model at the Jet Propulsion laboratory or JPL. \"The decomposition of those isotopes - over a period of about 7 million years - would produce enormous amounts of heat. This would result in the consolidation of rocky material at the core surrounded by a shell of ice. According to the theory, the remaining, more slowly decaying radioactivity in the core could continue to warm and melt the moon's interior for billions of years, along with tidal forces from Saturn's gravitational tug,\" said a statement on NASA\"s website. Data from Cassini's ion and neutral mass spectrometer further shows that the natural building blocks of life are also present within Enceladus. The results show that carbon dioxide, acetylene, methane, propane and nitrogen, the basic building blocks for life, are all present within the moon. \"The team concludes that so far, all the findings and the hot start model indicate that a warm, organic-rich mixture was produced below the surface of Enceladus and might still be present today, making the moon a promising kitchen for the cooking of primordial soup,\" added the statement.

Leading environmental scientist Professor Norman Myers says the Earth is experiencing its \"Sixth Extinction.\" Scientists forecast that up to five million species will be lost this century. \"We are well into the opening phase of a mass extinction of species. There are about 10 million species on earth. If we carry on as we are, we could lose half of all those 10 million species,\" Myers said. If we do not do more, Myers says, the planet will continue to lose around 50 species per day compared to the natural extinction rate of one species every five years. He projected this rate in the late 1980s to much criticism, but the figure is now widely accepted by scientists. \"The whole thing is taking place in what you might call a flickering of an evolutionary eye,\" said Myers. \"It's hard to keep up with unless we damp down on some of the causes of the evolution.\" The Australia Museum's Frank Howarth says \"There are over 30 extinction 'hotspots' across the globe. He says up to 80 per cent of crucial habitat has been wiped out.  Biodiversity hotspots are areas that have more than 1500 endemic plant species and which have lost more than 70per cent of original habitat.\" Hotspots feature, according to Myers, \"exceptional concentrations of species that are found nowhere else in the world.\" Evidence shows that insects, which account for more than half the described species on earth, are disappearing faster than birds. \"Many areas of Australia's ecosystems depend on the work of insects... we put a lot of effort into looking at these hotspots, about what insects actually occur there, whether their numbers are increasing or decreasing, because they tell us a lot more about some of the high level effects,\" Howarth said. Myers argues that we are destroying the Earth\u2019s biodiversity quickly enough to witness the beginning of a mass extinction of species\u2014one of only six such events in the Earth\u2019s history. He says around 30 hotspots contain the last remaining habitats of at least half of Earth\u2019s land surface. He says more parks and reserves are needed, and while warnings are desperate, he believes the situation can be turned around. \"We would be the first generation in the whole of human history since we came out of our caves to tackle a mass extinction head on and cancel it... and if we do, I think people will cheer for us from thousands of years ahead.\" Myers projects that safeguarding the hotspots would cost one billion dollars per year. The Global Amphibian Assessment, an international convention of amphibian biologists, indicated in 2004 that over a third of the world's amphibian species are threatened, making them the most threatened group of animals on the planet. More than 120 species have likely become extinct since the 1980s, and around two-thirds of the South American harlequin frog species vanished in the 1980s and 1990s. The decline of amphibians in protected habitats has puzzled conservation biologists for nearly 20 years. Recent research suggests that climate change may be driving widespread frog extinctions. Results of a study published in the January 2006 Nature journal reveal how warming alters a fatal skin fungus affecting frogs. The article says hundreds of species around the world are teetering on the brink of extinction or have already become extinct. \"Disease is the bullet that's killing the frogs,\" said J. Alan Pounds, the study's lead scientist from the Tropical Science Center in Costa Rica. \"But climate change is pulling the trigger. Global warming is wreaking havoc on amphibians, and soon will cause staggering losses of biodiversity,\" he said. According to the study, rising temperatures favor the chytrid fungus, which seems to kill frogs mostly in cool highlands or during winter\u2014implying that low temperatures make it more deadly. National Science Foundation program director Sam Scheiner said their study \"demonstrates the complex nature of global climate change, including how climate affects the spread of disease, and why these must be integrated if we are to understand and reduce threats to species extinctions.\" Scheiner says the message goes beyond amphibians: \"global warming and the accompanying emergence of infectious diseases are a real and immediate threat to biodiversity and a growing challenge for humankind.\" Scientists are warning that by the end of this century, the planet could lose up to half its species, and that these extinctions will alter not only biological diversity but also the evolutionary processes itself. They state that human activities have brought our planet to the point of biotic crisis. In 1993, Harvard biologist E.O. Wilson estimated that the planet is losing 30,000 species per year - around three species per hour. Some biologists have begun to feel that the biodiversity crisis dubbed the \"Sixth Extinction\" is even more severe, and more imminent, than Wilson had expected. Professor Myers and colleague Andrew H. Knoll say that what we do now will define a course for evolution. In their 2001 American Institute of Biological Sciences report, Myers and Knoll forecast that the effects of a Sixth Extinction will leave gene pools so depleted that species may not bounce back. Species such as rodents and cockroaches that have adapted to human environments will dominate. Niles Eldredge in his paper The Sixth Extinction says that with the high rate of extinction, there is little doubt left in the minds of professional biologists that the biosphere is currently facing a mounting, unprecedented loss of species. Whilst previous mass extinctions were due to natural environmental causes, research shows that wherever on Earth humans have migrated other species have become extinct. Human overpopulation especially in the past two centuries is said to be the underlying cause of the Sixth Extinction."}, "6-72": {"heading": "14 killed by bushfires in Australia ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/14_killed_by_bushfires_in_Australia", "date": "7-February-2009", "text": "Bushfires across the Australian state of Victoria have killed at least 108 people and have destroyed dozens of homes.

The model was published in Nature on October 22. Wikinews caught up with him in an email interview to find out more about his team's research and their plans for the future. The atmosphere of Mars  is far too thin for humans to breathe or for lungs like ours to extract any oxygen at all. It has on average only around 0.6% of the pressure of Earth's atmosphere, and this is mainly carbon dioxide; only 0.145% of the thin Martian atmosphere is oxygen. The new model indicated these minute traces of oxygen should be able to enter salty seeps of water on or near the planet's surface at levels high enough to support life forms comparable to Earth's microbes, possibly even simple sponges.  Some life forms can survive without oxygen, but oxygen permits more energy-intensive metabolism. Almost all complex multicellular life on Earth depends on oxygen. \"We were absolutely flabbergasted [...] I went back to recalculate everything like five different times to make sure it's a real thing,\" Stamenkovi\u0107 told National Geographic. \"Our work is calling for a complete revision for how we think about the potential for life on Mars, and the work oxygen can do,\" he told Scientific American, \"implying that if life ever existed on Mars it might have been breathing oxygen\". Stamenkovi\u0107 et al cite research from 2014 showing some simple sponges can survive with only 0.002 moles of oxygen per cubic meter (0.064 mg per liter). Some microbes that need oxygen can survive with as little as a millionth of a mole per cubic meter (0.000032 mg per liter). In their model, they found there can be enough oxygen for microbes throughout Mars, and enough for simple sponges in oases near the poles. In 2014, also suggesting multicellular life could exist on Mars, de Vera et al, using the facilities at the German Aerospace Center (DLR), studied some lichens, including Pleopsidium chlorophanum, which can grow high up in Antarctic mountain ranges. They showed those lichens can also survive and even grow in Mars simulation chambers. The lichens can do this because their algal component is able to produce the oxygen needed by the fungal component. Stamenkovi\u0107 et al's research provides a way for oxygen to get into the Martian brines without algae or photosynthesis. Stamenkovi\u0107 et al found oxygen levels throughout Mars would be high enough for the least demanding aerobic (oxygen-using) microbes, for all the brines they considered, and all the methods of calculation. They published a detailed map[3] of the distributions of solubility for calcium perchlorates for their more optimistic calculations, which they reckoned were closer to the true case, with and without supercooling. The lowest concentrations were shown in the tropical southern uplands. Brine in regions poleward of about 67.5\u00b0 to the north and about 72.5\u00b0 to the south could have oxygen concentrations high enough for simple sponges. Closer to the poles, concentrations could go higher, approaching levels typical of sea water on Earth, 0.2 moles per cubic meter (6.4 mg per liter), for calcium perchlorates. On Earth, worms and clams that live in the muddy sea beds require 1 mg per liter, bottom feeders such as crabs and oysters 3 mg per liter, and spawning migratory fish 6 mg per liter, all within 0.2 moles per cubic meter, 6.4 mg per liter. Stamenkovi\u0107 et al studied magnesium and calcium perchlorates, common on Mars. They found the highest oxygen concentrations occur when the water is colder, which happens most in polar regions. Stamenkovi\u0107 et al's paper is theoretical and is based on a simplified general circulation model of the Mars atmosphere \u2014 it ignores distinctions of seasons and the day / night cycle. Stamenkovi\u0107's team combined it with a chemical model of how oxygen would dissolve in the brines and used this to predict oxygen levels in such brines at various locations on Mars. When asked about plans for a future model that might include seasonal timescales, Stamenkovi\u0107 told Wikinews, \"Yes, we are now exploring the kinetics part and want to see what happens on shorter timescales.\" Stamenkovi\u0107 et al's model also takes account of the tilt of the Mars axis, which varies much more than Earth's does. Wikinews asked Stamenkovi\u0107 if he had any ideas about whether and how sponges could survive through times when the tilt was higher and less oxygen would be available: Wikinews also asked Stamenkovi\u0107 how their research is linked to the recent discovery of possible large subglacial lake below the Martian South Pole found through radar mapping."}, "6-76": {"heading": "Chinese market fire kills seventeen, child detained ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Chinese_market_fire_kills_seventeen,_child_detained", "date": "7-February-2015", "text": "Police detained a nine-year-old after a blaze started in a wholesale market in Huizhou, Guangdong, southern China on Thursday afternoon.

The sensor uses genetically engineered frog cells. Since previous sensors were not very accurate, the scientist decided to try a biological approach. The invention was revealed in a US scientific journal yesterday, and is supposed to be used to design better machines to detect polluting gases in the atmosphere. Previous smell sensors were based on quartz rods, which vibrate when a substance binds to them. The gases are distinguished by their molar masses, which can be similar for molecules with different structure, thus relatively often triggering a false positive. Trying to find a more accurate solution, Takeuchi decided to follow an example from insect world. As he explained, \"when you think about the mosquito, it is able to find people because of carbon dioxide from the human. So the mosquito has CO2 receptors. When we can (extract) DNA (from the mosquito) we can put this DNA into the frog eggs to detect CO2.\" Genes of several insects (the silk moth, diamondback moth and fruit fly), injected into African clawed frog Xenopus laevis eggs, allowed them to produce relatively inexpensive and useful sensors. The choice of the species was caused by their widely studied and well-understood protein expression mechanism. The modified cells responded to three kinds of pheromones and one odourant, which have similar chemical properties. When a molecule of an odorous substance adhered to the receptor on the membrane protein, ion channels opened for a certain period of time, and a current was generated. Its magnitude was clearly different for all four tested substances, allowing to distinguish between them accurately. The colleagues embedded the sensor into a mannequin, so that it could shake its head when a gas was detected. It was easier to observe. Pheromones and molecules with quite similar molecule structure produced clearly distinguishable reaction, with higher accuracy than other biological or human-made sensors. As the research group said, the detection sensitivity of the odor sensor is several tens of parts per billion (ppb), and it is as high as the sensitivity of an existing odor sensor that uses an oxide semiconductor. The distinctive feature of the new sensor is its capability to selectively detect some odorous substances, rather than its sensitivity. Very few false positives were possible due to the biological mechanism involved. At normal temperature, the sensor lifetime is about 12 hours, which can be extended by putting it into a refrigerator before first use. Shoji Takeuchi says has a great hope for research use in future, since the frog eggs are very practical for genetic engineering, and can be conveniently used to develop smell sensors for a wide range of gases. He said, \"The X. laevis oocyte has high versatility for the development of chemical sensors for various odorants. We believe that a shared ability to smell might open a new relationship between man and robot. .. The research will have wide implications... If the sensor is embedded in a nursing robot, it will be able to identify certain mouth odors or body odors. Also, it can be used for detecting CO2, air pollution, water pollution and food. It's very important for the environment.\""}, "6-79": {"heading": "Second day of snow in UK, disruption continues ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Second_day_of_snow_in_UK,_disruption_continues", "date": "21-December-2009", "text": "A second day of winter weather and snow has caused further disruption in the UK.

Two Amtrak employees were killed and at least 116 were injured, some seriously. The two killed were 54-year-old engineer Michael Kempf of Savannah, Georgia, and 36-year-old conductor Michael Cella of Orange Park, Florida.  Robert Sumwalt, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, told a press conference the passenger train had been diverted into a siding by a switch left \"literally locked, with a padlock\" in that position. The collision happened at about 2:35 am local time (0735 UTC) at a switching yard in the small city of Cayce. The Amtrak train, with reportedly 139 passengers and eight employees aboard, collided head on with the freight train, which was parked with no one on board. The Amtrak locomotive and the leading locomotive on the freight train were destroyed; the Amtrak locomotive and some of its passenger cars derailed, and one of those cars was folded in half. Several freight cars were crumpled, Reuters reported. In a press conference, the state governor, Henry McMaster, said the Amtrak locomotive was \"barely recognizable\" and described it as \"a horrible thing to see, to understand the force involved\". Harrison Cahill, a spokesman for Lexington County, gave a count of 116 injured, up from an initial report of 70; according to Derrec Becker, public information officer for the South Carolina Emergency Management Division, injuries ranged \"from cuts and bruises to severe broken bones\". On Monday a Palmetto Health spokesperson said two patients were in serious and two in critical condition at their facilities. A spill of approximately 5,000 gallons of fuel from the freight train posed no safety hazard, according to officials. Passenger Derek Pettaway told the CNN network that like most others, he had been sleeping when the collision happened. He said Amtrak staff cleared the passengers from the train rapidly, and there was no panic; \"I think people were more in shock than anything else\", he said. \"Key to this investigation is learning why the switch was lined that way\", Sumwalt said. Amtrak's CEO, Richard Anderson, speaking to reporters on Sunday, held CSX responsible; he stated the track in that area is operated by CSX and the signals, which CSX operates, were not working at the time of the collision and a CSX dispatcher was therefore directing the Amtrak train's movements. Sumwalt noted an automatic monitoring and braking system called positive train control, which was not in use on the stretch of line, could have forestalled the collision. Several fatal incidents involving Amtrak trains have occurred in the past three months. On December 18, the inaugural train on a new route in Washington state derailed at high speed while crossing above a highway, killing three; on January 31, the driver of a garbage truck was killed in Virginia when he collided with an Amtrak train chartered to take Republican lawmakers to a retreat."}, "6-81": {"heading": "Baseball: Oakland A's pitcher Dallas Braden throws perfect game ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Baseball:_Oakland_A%27s_pitcher_Dallas_Braden_throws_perfect_game", "date": "10-May-2010", "text": "Dallas Braden, a left-handed pitcher for Major League Baseball's Oakland Athletics in the United States, became one of only nineteen players in the history of the MLB to pitch a perfect game, in a 4-0 win against the Tampa Bay Rays.

Concern was high for the oil industry, as rough seas kept tankers from leaving their ports. Such storms are rare in the Middle East. Early today, Gonu was weakening and was downgraded to a tropical storm. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center projected the storm to continue weakening as it made landfall on Iran's southeastern coast. Offshore Iranian oil installations were expected to be spared, officials said. In the Omani capital, Muscat yesterday, there were torrential rains and howling winds, a rarity in the quiet coastal city. Streets were flooded and emergency vehicles were useless. Flights were canceled at Oman's Seeb International Airport. Twenty-three deaths were reported by Omani authorities today. Electricity and phone lines were out and roads flooded. Police said a body washed ashore in Sur. There were also reports of people trapped in homes in low-lying areas of the capital. Authorities used mobile-phone text messages to warn people away from dangerous areas. Residents were warned to stay at home, or seek shelter in buildings that could withstand the harsh weather. Shareefa bint Khalfan, Omani minister of social development, said more than 20,000 people were evacuated to government shelters.

Some major roads were flooded in southeastern Iran. In the port city of Bandar Abbas, winds shattered windows and knocked down billboards & trees. Oman has relatively small oil fields, and there was little damage to them. But oil exports were cut off, as the raging seas kept tankers battened down in port for a third day today. To the north, at the world's third-largest shipping fuel center in Fujairah, United Arab Emirates, all refueling and supply operations were suspended, and ships were kept in their berths. At the entrance to the Persian Gulf, the Strait of Hormuz, ships passed through, despite four- to six-foot swells and strong winds. About one-fifth of the world's oil passes through this narrow chokepoint. Iran, OPEC's No. 2 oil exporter, said the storm would not disrupt supplies because its main terminals were inside the Gulf waterway. Analysts were mixed on how the storm will affect prices at the gas pump. \"About 17-21 million barrels a day of oil are coming out of the Persian Gulf. Even if only some of the tankers are delayed, that could reduce the supply of oil and increase prices,\" Manouchehr Takin, at the Center for Global Energy Studies in London, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press. But Tim Evans, an analyst at Citigroup Global Markets, said while the storm may delay oil tankers, they will eventually get to their destinations, so prices shouldn't be affected too drastically. Oil prices rose US$0.25 to $65.86 a barrel in midday trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange.

The crash of Flight 38 injured one passenger seriously and 12 others on board, including four crew members, as well as being the first hull loss of a B777. The latest word from the United Kingdom's Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) is that both engines had low fuel pressure in their high pressure (HP) fuel inlets, leading to the failure of both engines. Having departed from Beijing, China the aircraft was on final approach for landing at Heathrow when the thrust on the engines first reduced and became unresponsive, then ceased completely. The copilot, who was flying the aircraft at the time, received significant media praise for gliding the aircraft past housing and airport barriers to crash land the airliner onto the grass at the runway threshold, likely saving the 136 passengers and 16 crew from death or further injury as well as preventing potential ground casualties. The landing gear collapsed and the airframe, wings and engines were significantly damaged. Each HP inlet also exhibited \"unusual and fresh cavitation damage to the outlet ports consistent with operation at low inlet pressure\", according to the AAIB's latest report on investigatory progress, which also states engine failure was definitely caused by low pressure and that the autothrottle had opened up appropriate valves fully in an effort to increase fuel flow, but to no avail. The report indicates the investigation has also considered an area of unusually cold air over Russia which the B777 passed through at 40,000 feet on its journey. Between the Ural mountain range and East Scandinavia the air was found to have been as low as -76\u00b0C. The AAIB has ruled out fuel turning to ice as the fuel temperature never fell below -34\u00b0C. This is compared to an average freezing temperature of -47\u00b0C for jet fuel and test showing the fuel in the B777's tanks needed cooled to at least -57\u00b0C before it froze. Floating ice particles had previously been suggested as a possible causal factor. However, it has been suggested outside of the investigation that although the fuel did not freeze, it could have become unusually thickened, restricting its flow through the HP inlets, although the temperatures did remain within what are currently considered safe levels. Another possible explanation was that the fuel was contaminated or of inferior quality, but the AAIB has ruled this out. Also disproved are suggestions that the plane suffered a bird strike or that it was disrupted by electromagnetic interference from jamming devices set up to protect a motorcade carrying Prime Minister Gordon Brown. The report says that there was also no evidence to suggest any control systems failed, that the aircraft encountered a wake vortex or that there was core engine icing or other evidence that the engines suffered core lock. There was no damage to the fuel systems excluding that caused by the low pressure and no blockages, therefore it is suspected that fuel flow was restricted. The investigation has also begun analysing previous flights on comparable aircraft in a large sample of flights. Thus far, no parameters present on Flight 38 have been found that differ significantly from anything previously encountered. The purpose is primarily to identify potentially troublesome combinations of unusual operational parameters. The report concludes by stating that interested parties to the investigation, specifically the Federal Aviation Administration, the European Aviation Safety Agency, the Civil Aviation Authority and British Airways are being kept fully informed of the investigation's progress. Although this shows some progress, according to David Learmount, operations and safety editor at periodical industry magazine Flight International, \u201cThis report takes us absolutely nowhere, I think they still have no idea.\u201d The B777 has never had any other hull losses or any fatal accidents and is considered to have one of the world's safest commercial airliners. According to one spokesman for British Airways \u201cIt has one of the best safety records of any commercial aircraft. At no stage since the accident has the AAIB, Boeing or Rolls Royce advised against the continued operation of the Boeing 777.\u201d The engines underwent analysis at manufacturer Rolls-Royce's facility in Derby, while airframer Boeing is studying the fuel systems in the United States.

Remarked Center for Biological Diversity scientist Tierra Curry, \"This reprieve from bad news on monarchs is a thank-you from the butterflies to all the people who planted native milkweeds and switched to organic corn and soy products[...] But one good weather year won't save the monarch in the long run, and more protections are needed for this migratory wonder and its summer and winter habitats.\" Milkweed is the sole food of the monarch caterpillar. According to ecologist Chip Taylor of the University of Kansas, last year's relatively cool temperatures in the insects' migration corridor kept them in the right place at the right time to lay eggs with a good chance of survival. He also said this is not likely to happen again next year. Ecologist Ryan Norris of the University of Guelph in Ontario also said human actions had little to do with the increased population. Almost all of the monarch butterflies ranging across the continent, as far north as Canada, return to the same wintering area in central Mexico's oyamel fir forests every year.  Scientists from the World Wildlife Fund Mexico estimate the population by observing the area turned orange by butterfly bodies on the trees.

The hibernation area was as large as 21 hectares in the 1990s and as low as under a hectare in 2014. Factors cited for the drop in the monarch's overall population include habitat loss, loss of milkweed to agricultural herbicides, and use of insecticides. The Center for Biological Diversity and Center for Food Safety requested monarch butterflies be given Endangered Species Act protections from the United States government in 2014.  The decision is pending and expected in June of this year.

For the neutral football fan the game was not especially attractive to look at. There were only 7 shots on target in the 90 minutes and neither team controlled the play well. The scrappy match was broken by up 37 fouls. The game had temperatures at around 90 degrees Fahrenheit, which caused several English players, including Beckham, to suffer from heat exhaustion and dehydration. Beckham was sick on the pitch shortly after his goal and was substituted before the end. [1] Ecuador had the best of the first 45 minutes. The slow tempo of the game seemed to lead to simple errors of concentration from England and favoured Ecuador's passing play. Ecuador had slightly more ball possession over the game and also the first chance. John Terry's back header to his keeper fell short but Ashley Cole slid in to deflect Carlos Tenorio's shot onto Paul Robinson's crossbar. In the second half England put more pressure on Ecuador's goal. However, passes into lone striker Wayne Rooney \u2013 who played 90 minutes for the first time since he recovered from injury \u2013 were often off-target. England's best chance to score from free play followed Wayne Rooney trickery on the left touchline. The striker evaded his marker but Frank Lampard spooned Rooney's cut back high over the bar. Beckham's free kick was a trademark fast curled pass from over 30 yards which beat the opposition wall and took a small touch off the fingertips of Cristian Mora before nestling into the bottom right corner of the net. The goal meant David Beckham had broken an English record by scoring in the 1998, 2002 and 2006 World Cups, the first English player ever to score in three different World Cups. England were scheduled to meet the winner of game 52, Portugal, in the quarter-final of the World Cup in Gelsenkirchen on July 1. Match 51 Attendance: 52'000 Substitutes denotes one goal scored.

In Harbin, city ice sculptors and organizers are building the giant Father Christmas, a 160 meters (525 ft) long and 24 meters high sculpture. It centers on an enormous face of Santa, complete with flowing beard and hat. Tang Guangjun, one of the sculptors, complained of the effects of global warming and hazardous conditions saying \"it is even bigger and higher than last year's, and more difficult. The weather swings between warm and cold, so it becomes very wet and slippery on the ice. It is very dangerous for us.\" He added that \"its huge size and unseasonably warm temperatures have made the job especially challenging.\" Organizers even have to use artificial snow. The mid-December to early February ice festival which officially begins on January 5, has consistently increased in size over the years, with more talented artists involved and more impressive techniques and pieces on show. Ice sculpture decoration ranges from the modern technology of lasers to traditional ice lanterns. The climate of Heilongjiang is very cold and ice is plentiful. Objects of all sizes appear, up to and including building-sized pieces. In Harbin, winter temperatures can drop to below minus 35 degrees Celsius (- 31 F). According to Jia Yan, director of the local tourism bureau, about 800,000 tourists, 90 per cent of them Chinese, are expected to visit the ice festival this year. Father Christmas or \"Shengdan laoren\" (literally \"The Old Man of Christmas\") is a name used in many English speaking countries, for the gift-bringing figure of Christmas. Although \"Father Christmas\" and \"Santa Claus\" have for all practical purposes been merged, historically the characters were different. The symbolic personification of Christmas as a merry old figure begins in the early 17th century, in the context of resistance to Puritan criticism of observation of the Christmas feast. He is \"old\" because of the antiquity of the feast itself, which its defenders saw as a good old Christian custom that should be kept. Allegory was popular at the time, and so \"old Christmas\" was given a voice to protest his exclusion, along with the form of a rambunctious, jolly old man. The earliest recorded personification of Christmas appears to be Ben Jonson's creation in \"Christmas his Masque\" dating from December 1616, in which Christmas appears \"attir'd in round Hose, long Stockings, a close Doublet, a high crownd Hat with a Broach, a long thin beard, a Truncheon, little Ruffes, white shoes, his Scarffes, and Garters tyed crosse\", and announces \"Why Gentlemen, doe you know what you doe? ha! would you ha'kept me out? Christmas, old Christmas?\" Later, in a masque by Thomas Nabbes, \"The Springs Glorie\" produced in 1638, \"Christmas\" appears as \"an old reverend gentleman in furred gown and cap\". The character continued to appear over the next 250 years, appearing as Sir Christmas, Lord Christmas, or Father Christmas, the last becoming the most common. According to early Christian origins Saint Nicholas of Myra is the primary inspiration for the Christian figure of Santa Claus. He was a 4th-century Greek Christian bishop of Myra in Lycia, a province of the Byzantine Anatolia, now in Turkey."}, "6-90": {"heading": "First snowfall of the season impacts the Northeast US ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/First_snowfall_of_the_season_impacts_the_Northeast_US", "date": "6-December-2009", "text": "A snowstorm, in many areas the first of the season, has impacted much of the Northeastern United States and Atlantic Canada today and is expected to continue until early on Sunday morning.

Baumgartner broke the sound barrier as his top speed reached 1342\u00a0km/h (834 miles per hour), exceeding the speed of sound, and landing in the New Mexico desert, United States. The jump follows several days of waiting for atmospheric winds to decrease to make sure the jump would be safe, and the capsule would not be blown away. A balloon with 850\u00a0megalitres (30 million cubic feet) of helium took over two hours to lift the Red Bull Stratos capsule to a 39\u00a0km altitude in the stratosphere, 2\u00a0km higher than expected, breaking a 1961 manned balloon record of 34.7\u00a0km (113,740 feet). While the capsule ascended, a helmet faceplate heater failed. Exhalation fogged the faceplate and affected vision. Baumgartner proceeded with the jump anyway. Baumgartner jumped with his head down to increase speed. A quick jump was essential to minimise the risk of spinning out of control which could make the skydiver lose consciousness. Baumgartner's suit was equipped with devices to document the jump, including a camera. They also included tools to measure altitude, speed and location, and to report them to the mission control center. After the successful jump, Baumgartner said, \"When I was standing there on top of the world, you become so humble, you do not think about breaking records anymore, you do not think about gaining scientific data.

Mandatory evacuation orders have been set in place, affecting 2,000 homes. The fire is one of three that ignited yesterday in the Mojave Desert and San Gabriel Mountains. The first was a 30-acre fire that began to the west of Lancaster in the Fairmont area. It was contained and suppressed by mid-afternoon, but the other two fires ignited while firefighters were battling the first. The second fire, the \"Briggs Fire\", began shortly after 2:00 pm near 8334 Soledad Canyon Road and Briggs Road, south of the freeway. It burned 500 acres south of the 14 Freeway, but the Los Angeles County Fire Department (LACFD) now has it contained, and firefighters are hopeful that it will burn itself out as it edges closer to the 160,577-acre burn area of last year's Station Fire. The third fire, the \"Crown Fire\", broke out at around the same time as the Briggs Fire on the northern side of the 14 Freeway near Acton. The Crown fire has so far burned 13,000 acres and has been heading north into Leona Valley and Palmdale. Over 800 firefighters are now tackling the Crown Fire on the ground, Boeing 747 and McDonnell Douglas DC-10 fixed-wing aircraft have taken to the skies to drop Phos-Chek slurry (a red powdery fire retardant that is a mixture of mostly water and fertilizer, and doesn't evaporate) on the fire, and modified Sikorsky UH-60 Black Hawk helicopters known as \"Firehawks\" are making water-drops. As well as LACFD, firefighters from Los Angeles City Fire Department, California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection (Cal Fire) are also helping to battle the fire. Weather conditions and topography have hindered their efforts, as temperatures rose to 98 degrees Fahrenheit today, with windspeeds of 25mph. Tonight, the National Weather Service predicts winds will reach as high as 50mph. The fire burned down a Los Angeles County Sheriff Department communications tower, forcing Lancaster and Palmdale-based deputies to set up mobile operations bases and coordinate their efforts using cell phones and computers. Last night, the California Aqueduct acted as a barrier to the fire. Residents of Leona Valley, Lake Elizabeth, Ritter Ranch, Rancho Vista, Ana Verde and Palmdale received Reverse 911 telephone calls last night alerting them of mandatory evacuations. Many of the evacuation orders were lifted this morning as the spread of the fire decreased. However, as winds picked up in the afternoon, fire embers were carried across the aqueduct and the fire is now heading towards a highly-populated area of Palmdale. Residents who were allowed back into their homes were re-evacuated to Red Cross shelters set up in local schools and parks.The fire is also threatening five high-voltage power lines that supply electricity to much of Southern California. 21 customers in the immediate vicinity have been without power since yesterday. At 5:00 pm, California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, police and fire officials held a press conference. The governor said that the fire was 20% contained and had burned 13,000 acres.

Egypt, Bulgaria, and Nicaragua each reported their first case, while Lebanon reported three. The WHO's pandemic alert level is at the fifth level, on a scale of one to six. In order for a transition for the highest level to be made, the organisation must confirm a significant spread of swine flu in at least two continents. The WHO has recently been under pressure to include the severity of a disease spread to its criteria, not just the geographical spread of a virus. The WHO said that its committee had agreed that a statement on the strength of an epidemic should be made in any future pandemic declarations. \"There was a broad consensus on the importance of including information on severity in future announcements,\" the WHO said in a statement.

There are a further 47 laboratory results pending confirmation. Francisco Duque, the Philippine's health secretary, said six of the cases were in Filipinos who had returned from visits to the U.S. \"With further characterization of the virus in our local cases, if we see that A/H1N1 poses no severe threat and is self-limited in most cases, we may be seeing a shift in our control strategy to outpatient and home management of patients showing only mild symptoms,\" Duque said. Russia has reported its first case of the flu, in an unidentified 28-year-old man who had recently been in New York. The man had initially passed a medical check when he arrived at Moscow's Sheremetyevo International Airport last Monday, but began to feel ill two days later and was hospitalised the same day. It is currently uncertain how he obtained the virus. Russian officials are currently screening flights that have departed from \"countries of concern\", including all countries in the Americas, as well as Japan and Spain. People arriving on flights from such countries have their temperatures checked by remote sensors, and those with high temperatures are hospitalised and tested for the H1N1 virus.
