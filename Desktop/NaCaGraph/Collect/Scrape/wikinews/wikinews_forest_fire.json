Nearly two million people annually visit Chester Zoo, reportedly the largest annual draw of any zoo in the UK not in London. However, the fire caused it to shut down on Saturday. The monsoon forest habitat, where the fire occurred, housed, amongst other creatures, crocodiles, orangutans, macaques, and birds. In an attempt to replicate the conditions of South East Asia, it was kept at a temperature of 26.6\u00b0C (about 80\u00b0F). Reports passed on by witnesses indicated zoo personnel evaluated at least 40 animals from the area. The zoo reopened on Sunday. Although all the mammals reportedly survived, some of the frogs, insects, and small birds housed there died. The fire spread very quickly and strong winds helped the fire spread so fast.

Because of the lawsuit, SP AusNet SPN.AX's shares on Monday have dropped more than 13.36 per cent or 14.5 cents, to an intra-day low of 94 cents, was at 98.5 cents at 10:38 a.m. local time, before recovering slightly to be 7.5 cents lower at A$1.01 by 1144 AEDT (0003 GMT) or 6.9 percent in Sydney trading. Shares in SP AusNet closed 3.7 percent lower at A$1.045 on Monday. Power supplier SP AusNet said it has asked the Victoria Court regarding the status of the class action proceedings saying the firm had insurance policies in place consistent with industry standards. \"SP AusNet will continue to update the market as further information becomes available,\" the company said. The claim has focused on alleged negligence by SP AusNet in its management of electricity infrastructure. It maintains most of the power lines in eastern Victoria. Its fallen power line is believed to have sparked the blaze that tore through Kinglake, Steels Creek, Strathewen, Humevale, and St Andrews. The plaintiffs include thousands of angry Kinglake farmers, small business owners, tourist operators and residents who lost homes. Leo Keane, the lead plaintiff in the class action has alleged \"SP AusNet owed a duty of care to landowners to operate and manage power lines in a way that limited the risk of damage from bushfires.\" On Thursday Phoenix Taskforce had taken away a section of power line as well as a power pole from near Kilmore East, part of a two-kilometre section of line in Kilmore East that fell during strong winds and record heat about 11am last Saturday. It was believed to have started the fire there, since within minutes a nearby pine forest was ablaze, and within six hours the bushfire had almost obliterated nearly every building in the towns in its path. \"It is believed that the claim will be made on the basis of negligent management of power lines and infrastructure,\" Slidders Lawyers partner Daniel Oldham said. The law firm has announced it was helping landowners and leaseholders get compensation for the 2003, 2006, 2007 and 2009 bushfires. \"If you have been burnt by the recent bushfires, please register your interest using the form below as soon as possible,\" the law firm's website stated. The Insurance Council of Australia has placed the cost of the bushfires at about $500 million. \"That means keeping electricity lines clear of trees and in a condition that won't cause fires. They must also have systems in place to identify and prevent risks occurring,\" Melbourne barrister Tim Tobin, QC, said. According to the 2006 census, Kinglake had a population of almost 1,500 people. But SP AusNet's legal liability has been limited at $100 million under an agreement inked by the former Kennett government with private utility operators, when the former State Electricity Commission was privatized in 1995. Accordingly, the Brumby Government could be legally obliged to pay damages of the differences amounting to hundreds of millions of dollars. SP AusNet Ltd said some of its electricity assets have been damaged by the Victoria bushfire. \"As a preliminary estimate, it is thought that damage has been sustained to approximately one per cent of SP AusNet\u2019s electricity distribution network, mainly distribution poles, associated conductors and pole top transformers,\" SP AusNet said in a statement to the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX). It explained that up to 6,000 homes and businesses on its network were without power due to bushfires, including the Kinglake complex fire, Beechworth fire, and fires across Gippsland including Churchill and Bunyip. SP AusNet said the firm will cooperate fully and will assist in any fire probe. \"We stand ready to assist the relevant authorities with their inquiries if it is necessary for us to do so now and in the coming months,\" SP Ausnet spokeswoman Louisa Graham said in a statement. \"Our priority is to restore power to fire-affected areas as quickly as possible. We believe the claim is premature and inappropriate ... SP AusNet will vigorously defend the claim. If the claim is pursued, SP AusNet advises that it has liability insurance which provides cover for bushfire liability. The company's bushfire mitigation and vegetation management programmes comply with state regulations and were audited annually by state agencies,\" Grahams explained. Victorian Auditor-General Rob Hulls said \"there was an 'unseemly rush' by some lawyers to sue before the cause of the fires had been fully investigated.\" \"The government body had audited the network's bushfire risk to make sure required distances between power lines and vegetation were maintained. Power companies had been given a clean bill of health, and electricity firms were judged to be 'well prepared for the 2008-09 bushfire season.' There were no regulations applying to the distances between poles supporting electricity lines and spans of one kilometre were not unusual,\" a spokesman for Energy Safe Victoria explained. Christine Nixon, the 19th and current Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police said investigations into the cause of the bushfires were ongoing. \"I know people are angry, and so are all of us in this community. But we need to kind of have a sense that the proper processes are in place and we need to go through the investigation and through the court case,\" Nixon said. \"At this stage we are not able to confirm how it started. I understand there is some legal action that people are taking, but at this stage we're still investigating its cause. But the whole circumstances of that fire are part of our Taskforce Phoenix, and as we move through that we'll be able to tell the community more once we're able to confirm or deny what we think is the cause of these fires,\" Nixon added. On Thursday, two people were arrested in connection with the fires, having been observed by members of the public acting suspiciously in areas between Yea and Seymour; although they were both released without charges laid. Brendan Sokaluk, age 39, from Churchill in the Gippsland region, was arrested by police at 4pm on Thursday, in relation to the Churchill fires, and was questioned at the Morwell police station. He was charged on Friday with one count each of arson, intentionally lighting a bushfire and possession of child pornography. The arson case relates to 11 of the 21 deaths in the dire  Gippsland fire, which devastated 39,000 hectares in the Latrobe Valley, Calignee, Hazelwood Koornalla and Jeeralang. Two teams of Churchill firefighters were almost lost in the inferno that remains out of control. Mr Sokaluk joined the CFA Churchill brigade in the late 1980s as a volunteer fire fighter, left in the 1990s and attempted to rejoin twice, but was rejected. He failed to appear in Melbourne Magistrate's Court Monday for a scheduled hearing, since the court reset the committal hearing on May 25. He is represented by lawyer Julian McMahon. Magistrate John Klestadt has lifted the suppression order which kept the suspect's identity a secret but identifying photographs were barred from being released. Mr Sokaluk was remanded in protective custody from Morwell to a cell in Melbourne for his own safety amid fears angry prisoners will target him and real risk of vigilante attacks. He faces a maximum sentence of 25 years imprisonment if convicted on the arson charge. \"This is an extraordinary case. The level of emotion and anger and disgust that the alleged offenses have aroused in the community is unprecedented.\" Mr Sokaluk's defense lawyer Helen Spowart argued. The prosecution has moved the Court for more time to prepare its case, saying there would be up to 200 witnesses to interview. Slater & Gordon has indicated that they were awaiting the report of the to-be-established Royal Commission, expected in late 2010, before initiating any claims. Armed with a $40 million budget, the Royal Commission's Chair Justice Bernard Teague will be assisted by former Commonwealth ombudsman Ron McLeod, who led the inquiry into the 2003 Canberra bushfires, and State Services Authority Commissioner Susan Pascoe. The Commission has said its interim report is due on August 17 while the final report will be submitted by July 31, 2010. Judge Bernard Teague has announced Tuesday he will meet with fire victims and fire authorities within the next two weeks. \"We want to do that as soon as possible - probably not next week but starting to have these discussions the week after,\" he said. Julia Eileen Gillard, the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and deputy leader of the federal Australian Labor Party (ALP) said the federal and Victorian governments would respond quickly to the royal commission's report. \"Everybody who has lived through this experience in Victoria and around the nation has asked the question: 'Why? What can we do better?'. No one wanted to see the report \"as a book on a shelf gathering dust,\" she said. Victoria bushfire experts, led by Forest Fire Victoria - a group of scientists and forestry experts - have condemned the government's \"Living with Fire\" policy and the state's failure to initiate serious fuel-reduction programs. The Victoria government had failed to seriously act on bushfire safety recommendations submitted last June by the Victorian Parliamentary Environment and Natural Resources Committee. As death toll rises, evidence mounts of lack of planning prior to Australia\u2019s worst bushfire. \"Living with Fire\" policy means Kinglake fire trucks were dispatched to an earlier fire in Kilmore, leaving Kinglake undefended. \"Kinglake was left with no fire brigade and no police. The trucks had been sent to Kilmore. I've been in the fire brigade for 10 years. There was always a law\u2014the trucks had to be on the hill. Because of the government we got gutted at Kinglake. They should have been getting generators ahead of the fire\u2014so people would have had a chance of fighting it. As soon as the power went, I couldn't keep fighting the fire at my place,\" Rick and Lauren Watts, and their friend Neil Rao, spoke to the WSWS. Rick has also criticized the lack of early warning communications systems, since emergency siren warnings in the town had been stopped some years earlier. Humevale resident Sina Imbriano who has six children was angry about the failure of  state and federal governments to set up a recommended telephone warning system amid its \"stay and defend or go\" policy. Bald Spur Road residents Greg Jackson and his wife Fotini said the government's \"stay and defend or go\" policy was \"fruitless\" since the critical issue was early warnings,  but \"they [the government] just won't spend the money.\" Also on Friday, five law firms from Victoria's Western Districts, including Warrnambool-based Maddens Lawyers and Brown & Proudfoot, held a meeting to discuss a potential class action in relation to the Horsham fire, which was also thought to have been started by fallen power pole that burnt vast swathes of land in Mudgegonga and Dederang, Victoria. The lawsuit will also focus on the fire that blackened about 1750 hectares at Coleraine. Maddens senior attorney Brendan Pendergast said: \"We don't know who the defendant is at this stage. We are unsure who the electrical supplier is for that area but we should know in a few days. There were people who had their homes burnt to the ground and they will need to reconstruct, replace their contents,\" he said. Maddens has initiated a register of affected landowners for the recent bushfires, saying the firm has included victims of the Pomborneit fire that burnt almost 1300 hectares in the proposed class action amid the CFA's statement the blaze could have been deliberately lit. Frances Esther \"Fran\" Bailey, Liberal member of the Australian House of Representatives (1990-93 and 1996-present), representing the electorate of McEwen in Victoria said the Country Fire Authority (CFA) had told her one of the power lines had broken before the fire. \"The local CFA [Country Fire Authority] told me on that Saturday, with those very high winds, one of the lines had broken and was whipping against the ground and sparked,\" she said. \"Whether or not that is the cause of that terrible fire that actually took out Kinglake and maybe Marysville, the investigations will prove that, but we've got to do better,\" she added. Victorian Premier John Brumby said the power line claim would be examined as part of the Royal Commission into the bushfire. \"No stone will be left unturned. So, I think it's important the Royal Commission does its work. And, the Royal Commission will, of course, look at all of the factors with the fires,\" Mr Brumby said. At least 550 houses were incinerated and 100 people have been killed, leaving more than 1,000 homeless in the Kinglake bushfire and surrounding areas. SP AusNet - Singapore Power International Pte Ltd is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Singapore Power Limited (51% interest in SP AusNet). SP AusNet's electricity transmission and distribution networks, along with the gas distribution assets, enable it to deliver a full range of energy-related products and services to industrial and domestic customers in Victoria, Australia. Singapore Power ( \u65b0\u52a0\u5761\u80fd\u6e90\u6709\u9650\u516c\u53f8) is a company which provides electricity and gas transmission, distribution services, and market support services to more than a million customers in Singapore. As the only electricity company in Singapore, and also one of its largest corporation, SP was incorporated as a commercial entity in October 1995 to take over the electricity and gas businesses of the state provider, the Public Utilities Board. Since 1995, Temasek Holdings controls the entire company with a 100% stake. SP is involved in a major investment in Australia's Alinta in partnership with Babcock & Brown, after putting up a bid of A$13.9 billion (S$17 billion), beating out a rival bid by Macquarie Bank. The devastating 2009 Victorian Black Saturday bushfires, a series of more than 400 bushfires across Victoria on February 7 2009, is Australia's worst-ever bushfire disaster, claiming at least 200 deaths, including many young children, and is expected to pass 300. 100 victims have been admitted to hospitals across Victoria with burns, at least 20 in a critical condition, and 9 on life support or in intensive care. The fires have destroyed at least 1,834 homes and damaged many thousands more. Many towns north-east of Melbourne have been badly damaged or almost completely destroyed, including Kinglake, Marysville, Narbethong, Strathewen and Flowerdale. Over 500 people suffered fire-related injuries and more than 7,000 are homeless. It has scorched more than 1,500 square miles (3,900 square kilometers) of farms, forests and towns.

The study was performed in two national parks in California, United States. For the past twenty-five years, spotted owl habitat preservation has focused on keeping 70% or more of the total ground area covered by natural tree canopy, a tree density that leaves forests prone to wildfires and trees more likely to die during droughts. Both wildfires and droughts have become more frequent in the years since the program began. However, the previous studies upon which the 70% figure was based only measured overall canopy coverage. In this work, researchers used aerial LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) imaging technology to scan areas within Kings Canyon National Park and Sequoia National Park in California. The regions were analyzed by distribution of foliage, tree height, and the sizes of the spaces between trees and stands. These data were then cross-referenced with decades of field studies showing the locations of hundreds of owl nests.  They found that spotted owls clustered in areas with very tall trees and stands almost exclusively, over 150 feet (48 m), avoiding areas that only had moderate or low canopy, regardless of how dense or wide. \"This could fundamentally resolve the management problem because it would allow for reducing small tree density, through fire and thinning,\" said lead author Malcolm North, of UC Davis and the USDA Pacific Southwest Research Station. \"We've been losing the large trees, particularly in these extreme wildfire and high drought-mortality events. This is a way to protect more large tree habitat, which is what the owls want, in a way that makes the forest more resilient to these increasing stressors that are becoming more intense with climate change.\" The spotted owl gained national prominence in the United States during the 1990s, when environmentalists' efforts to preserve its habitat resulted in federal measures forbidding logging on large swaths of land, as well as federal limits on the sales of harvested wood. There was a 1995 U.S. Supreme Court case which was preceded by lawsuits on the part of timber companies and by years of large protests by timber workers and their communities who feared job losses.  For a time, it seemed that the spotted owl was also threatened by competition from the faster-breeding barred owl, which had moved west into its territory. This is not the only major study of spotted owls to reach the public eye this week.  On Thursday, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service released the California Spotted Owl Conservation Objectives Report, which analyzes the past several decades of research on the California spotted owl and provides recommendations for ecologically and economically viable conservation."}, "4-29": {"heading": "House fire in Buffalo, N.Y. leaves two families homeless ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/House_fire_in_Buffalo,_N.Y._leaves_two_families_homeless", "date": "17-August-2006", "text": "Buffalo, New York \u2014 A resident living on the second floor of the two family house called 911 at around 8:00 p.m. on August 16, 2006 and reported the smell of smoke.

News reports have suggested that the claim originated in a 1999 article in the popular science magazine New Scientist, and was picked up by the IPCC when it was quoted in a 2005 report by the World Wildlife Fund. Jairam Ramesh, India's minister of Environment and Forests, had criticized the estimate when the report was initially released. After the announcement, Ramesh reiterated his criticism and told The Times of India: \"The health of the glaciers is a cause of grave concern, but the IPCC's alarmist position that they would melt by 2035 was not based on an iota of scientific evidence.\" According to The Times (UK), most glaciologists believe it would take hundreds of years to melt the Himalayan glaciers, with some doubting that it will ever happen. There is evidence of glaciers growing in the neighboring Karakoram mountain range. Michael Zemp, of the World Glacier Monitoring Service told CNN that, \"There are simply no observations available to make these sorts of statements.\" \"The other thing is that the report says the glaciers are receding faster than anywhere else in the world. We simply do not have the glacier change measurements. The Himalayas are among those regions with the fewest available data\", Zemp added. Nevertheless, the IPCC maintains that the melting of the glaciers is a concern to the region, which is home to over one billion people. It stands by its overall conclusion that \"mass losses from glaciers and reductions in snow cover over recent decades are projected to accelerate throughout the 21st century, reducing water availability, hydropower potential, and changing seasonality of flows in regions supplied by meltwater from major mountain ranges.\" The IPCC had recently come under fire during the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, when selectively leaked e-mails, hacked from the University of East Anglia, reportedly showed that some scientists were attempting to suppress findings by other climatologists that did not agree with their own findings."}, "4-31": {"heading": "Smoke from Arizona fire spreads to other states ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Smoke_from_Arizona_fire_spreads_to_other_states", "date": "7-June-2011", "text": "Smoke from eastern Arizona's Wallow Fire has drifted into New Mexico and Colorado, where officials have issued a health advisory.

When you start to have tightness in the chest, then it\u2019s serious.\" Patients have been taken away by road, as the smoke prevented any air transportation. The blaze began May 29 in the Bear Wallow area and has become the second largest in Arizona's history.

The crime scenes are believed to include an area surrounding a burnt out vehicle believed to belong to the victims, a house where the murders are thought to have occurred, and areas in the State Forest. 27-year-old Stacey Lea-Caton voluntarily attended Nowra Police Station and told officers he had witnessed a man and woman being tied up in a house in Nowra and he feared they were about to be murdered by another man and woman. Police then attended a property in Calymea Street, Nowra, where 36-year-old Kim Leanne Snibson agreed to accompany them to the station for questioning. Lea-Caton and Snibson have both been charged with two counts of murder and faced Nowra Local Court today. Magistrate Doug Dick issued a suppression order on the identities of the victims, but refused Snibson\u2019s request for a suppression order on her identity to protect her children who attend a local school, saying the court processes must be transparent. Lea-Caton appeared briefly in the court dock but Snibson refused and remained in the cells. They did not apply for bail and both were remanded into custody to appear in court on April 10."}, "4-50": {"heading": "Wildfires rage north of Los Angeles (category Fires) ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wildfires_rage_north_of_Los_Angeles", "date": "13-October-2008", "text": "Two large wildfires burn uncontrolled north of Los Angeles, California. The blazes, known as the Marek fires, have burned over 3700 acres and caused the evacuation of more than 1200 people. Furthermore, at least 30 mobile homes were destroyed. One confirmed fatality has been reported and described as an unidentified transient who had been using a cardboard shelter beneath a freeway overpass. However, the Associated Press reports a second related death from a traffic accident. Authorities expect to order more evacuations before the fires can be brought under control. Fires started Sunday due to Santa Ana wind conditions in the San Fernando Valley and Angeles National Forest on the northern outskirts of Los Angeles. Affected communities include Porter Ranch and the Lopez Canyon area. Santa Ana winds as strong as 65 miles per hour fanned the flames, which jumped the eight-lane 210 Freeway. Both the 210 Freeway and 118 Freeway were closed during Monday morning rush hour. Firefighters have contained smaller blazes that occurred elsewhere in Southern California near the Los Angeles suburb of Santa Clarita and in neighbouring Ventura County. Local resident Glenn Bell told Reuters about his last minute evacuation.  \"The sparks were flying down on us,\" he said, recalling how a locked gate nearly trapped him and his family, \"and as I'm busting the gate... I see the cypress trees that are right next to our house on fire.\" Los Angeles County fire inspector Frank Garrido described the problem as \"a blowtorch we can\u2019t get in front of,\" according to The New York Times. \"Wind is king here, it\u2019s dictating everything we are doing,\" he continued. Scott Stephens of the Center for Fire Research & Outreach at the University of California, Berkeley calls Southern California's Santa Ana winds \"some of the strongest, most severe fire winds in the world.\" Among the problems caused by Santa Ana winds, which blow from the nearby Mojave Desert toward the Pacific Ocean, is a tendency for hot embers to leapfrog and start new fires.  Santa Ana conditions tend to occur from autumn through spring and can reach peak speeds of 70 miles per hour (113 kilometers per hour)."}, "4-51": {"heading": "Plane crash in Equatorial Guinea kills 55 ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Plane_crash_in_Equatorial_Guinea_kills_55", "date": "17-July-2005", "text": "An Equatair plane carrying 55 people crashed on Saturday soon after take-off near the capital of Equatorial Guinea, Malabo.

The wreck occurred shortly after 2 pm, as driver Travis Stewart, 30, of Rexburg, Idaho, was leaving Ensign-Bickford Co., a commercial explosives manufacturing plant at the mouth of the canyon. Company officials said the truck was destined for Oklahoma. Witnesses said Mr. Stewart appeared to lose control of the truck after entering a curve in the road at a high rate of speed. Utah Highway Patrol Lt. Ken Peay said, \"speed was a factor\" in the wreck of the truck but refused to speculate on how fast the truck was traveling when it wrecked. Lt. Peay said the posted speed limit on the road is 60 mph, but the advised speed is 40. At least 17 people received minor injuries and the explosion left a 35 foot deep crater in the highway. The driver was transported via helicopter to a hospital, where he was listed in fair condition, and was later released. The co-driver Troy Lysfjord, 37, of Blackfoot, Idaho, was helped from the wreck by passers by and listed in fair condition at Utah Valley Regional Hospital in Provo. The wreck site occurred on a major thoroughfare between Denver and Salt Lake City - about 60 miles south of Salt Lake City - was already under reconstruction by nightfall, as road crews began installing 10 inches of asphalt on the two lane road. Utah Department of Transportation spokesman Tom Hudachko said officials hoped to have the road fully repaired by Friday afternoon, adding that, \"When you take a look at that hole that was there 24 hours ago, I think it's amazing the progress that was made.\" As of press time, the mouth of the canyon was reopened to traffic, while traffic at the accident site was impassible, and rerouted nearby. The explosion consumed all but about 60 pounds of explosives, and loosened some boulders on the north side of the highway, damaged railroad tracks and some fiber optic lines buried along the roadway. Amtrak and Union Pacific reported delays resulting from the wreck. Uinta National Forest spokesman Loyal Clark said forest firefighters were unable to respond to several small fires nearby that were apparently started by flying debris, and that helicopters dropped water to extinguish them. High humidity and lack of fuel from a previous fire delayed the fire's spread. The cost of repairs, while paid immediately by the state, will ultimately be borne by the trucking company's insurance carrier. The truck is registered to R&R Trucking of Duenweg, Missouri. UHP Lt.

The last entry, which has since been removed from public view, was posted on November 18, 2004 and read: A diverse group of users, both friends and strangers, have posted over 5,000 comments on the journal, positive and negative, transforming the case into an Internet phenomenon. Every entry since March 2004 has apparently now been deleted or hidden, but a ZIP archive of the entire weblog, from before the entries were deleted, is available on Deadly Blogging. Waterman was a tenth-grade honor (A-average) student in her second year at Craig High School. She was also a member of the Academic Decathlon team (ACDC) and sang in the choir, a profile that has left many people questioning her involvement in the killing and asking what motive there might be. At the time police say the killing occurred, Rachelle Waterman was apparently playing in a volleyball tournament in Anchorage, Alaska. Apart from the online diary Rachelle kept, the case is also unusual because matricide committed by female minors is extremely rare. The Waterman family is a locally prominent, middle-upper class family. Born on August 26, 1988, Rachelle showed an interest in acting, computers, movies and music, and was an honor roll student, involved in many extra-curricular activities, including choir, volleyball, and the decathlon team - advancing to upper levels and winning prizes in almost every endeavor. Her mother, Lauri, was a teachers' aide and served on the board of the Little League and the town library. Rachelle Waterman's 60-year-old father, Carl \"Doc\" Waterman, is a real estate agent and serves as president of the Craig School Board. Rachelle's older brother, Geoffrey, lives out of town and is a student at Tacoma College. Waterman and her alleged accomplices, Jason Arrant and Brian Radel, both 24 years old, are accused of murdering and conspiring to murder Waterman's 48-year-old mother, Lauri Waterman. Reportedly, Arrant dropped Radel off near the Waterman home shortly after 12:00 a.m. Sunday, November 13, 2004 (local time) where Radel proceeded to kidnap Lauri Waterman, force her into a minivan owned by the Waterman family, and kill her with a blunt object. Arrant and Radel then allegedly met at Forest Service Road 3012 at about 2:30 a.m., and Arrant followed Radel to its dead end, where Radel had driven the Waterman's van. Arrant then allegedly watched as Radel doused the body and van with gasoline and then used a roll of paper towels to set it on fire, in an attempt to destroy the evidence. Alaska State Police Lt. Rodney Dial has stated that a hunter discovered Lauri Waterman's body and her burnt-out van, while driving on Forest Service Road 3012, a remote logging road, early in the afternoon of Sunday November 142004. On Saturday, November 202004, Alaska State Police Trooper Robert Claus stated: On Saturday, November 20, 2004, Rachelle appeared in Craig District Court, dressed in an orange CCJF jumpsuit, for arraignment on the charges. Waterman and her alleged co-conspirators, Jason Arrant, and Brian Radel, faced a 10-count indictment, listing 26 felonies. The Fairbanks Daily News-Miner reported that, \"the complaint against Rachelle Waterman relied on statements by all three co-defendants. The complaint says the girl told one of the suspects when she and her father would be out of town.\" A report in The Ketchikan Daily News stated that, \"The first seven counts of the indictment allege that all three defendants committed the crimes of conspiracy to commit first-degree murder; first-degree murder; second-degree murder; kidnapping; first-degree burglary; first-degree vehicle theft and tampering with physical evidence.\" Other charges were made against Arrant and Radel. The same report went on to state, \"Trooper Robert Claus, Klawock resident Jan Bush and Deputy State Medical Examiner Susan Klingler testified before the grand jury.\" Magistrate Kay Clark presided over the arraignment and set bail at $150,000. Clark also appointed a public defender to represent Rachelle, who was sent to the Juneau Department of Corrections facility. Judge Patricia Collins, of the Juneau Superior Court, has been assigned to run the trial for the case. Judge Collins originally set a date of February 3, 2005 for the trial, but, at an arraignment that week, the trial was rescheduled for August 22.  According to court officials, another postponement is likely. Rachelle Waterman's court-appointed attorney for the trial is Assistant Public Advocate Steven Wells. Assistant District Attorney Daniel Schally is assigned to prosecute the case. No motive for the crime has been suggested. Readers are closely scrutinizing Rachelle's online journal for clues. As early as February 24th of 2004, she posted the following: Numerous readers have pointed to Rachelle's negative comments concerning her mother's wishes to send her to a \"fat farm\" to lose weight. In another incident, her mother grounded her (restricted her to home) for receiving an 89% score on a test. Rachelle posted these comments to her journal in response to this situation (verbatim spelling): Other readers have pointed to the title of Rachelle's journal, \"My Crappy Life (The Inside Look of an Insane Person)\", and her negative description of her hometown as \"Hell, Alaska, United States\": Rachelle posted the following poem to her journal on August 24, 2004, with an indication that she was depressed: She also had a strong desire not to be at home: and even posted an \"Ode to Suicide\" under the following post: Finally, the weekend before Rachelle left on a trip, during which time her mother was allegedly killed, she noted in her second-to-last entry, \"I had a migraine from about 9am-6pm\". Rachelle Waterman is currently incarcerated at the Lemon Creek correctional facility, in Alaska. She signed an agreement to be placed into the general population. Corrections Deputy Commissioner Portia Parker indicated that Waterman \"is an adult in the eyes of the law.\" Alaska law places persons charged with first-degree murder at the age of 16 or older in the adult court system, and most of the records concerning this case are open to the public for inspection. One of the last entries in Rachelle's journal wonders whether anyone is reading her comments (verbatim spelling): Although Waterman has not yet been convicted, sociologists and forensic psychologists are beginning to study her journal and the circumstances of her writing it. (The police have seized her computer and are examining the contents of its hard drive for evidence.) LiveJournal has subsequently restricted the viewing of her journal. When interviewed by Alaskan television station KTUU about the nature of online journals, (in late November, 2004) forensic psychologist Susan LaGrande commented that \"[i]t's such an anonymous vehicle that you can be whoever or say whatever you want. You don't have all the responsibilities that are inherent in a face-to-face real, legitimate relationship. This same report pointed out that Rachelle Waterman had mentioned suicide in her online journal. Criminologist Susan Magestro was interviewed by KTUU on the subject of juvenile crime, in late November, 2004, after Waterman became the second teenager within two months to be accused of murdering her own parent.  She stated that \"I think that we're starting to see more violence with kids who are younger, and the behaviors that they're exhibiting are more aggressive and more violent.\" Magestro also opined that \"we've got a lot more fetal alcohol and drug children who are growing up, and they don't understand the consequences of some of their actions.\" (There is no indication that Waterman was a so-called \"fetal alcohol\" or \"drug\" child.) KTUU reported that Magestro \"...blames violent movies, TV shows and videogames for desensitizing young people, making them unable to understand the consequences -- or even the reality -- of their actions.\" Although Waterman has been waived into the adult justice system due to the nature of the crime, the Governor of Alaska, Frank Murkowski, has proposed increasing the number of personnel assigned to the juvenile justice system."}, "4-57": {"heading": "Partially collapsed building in Buffalo, New York likely to be demolished ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Partially_collapsed_building_in_Buffalo,_New_York_likely_to_be_demolished", "date": "13-June-2008", "text": "Buffalo, New York \u2014 During the early afternoon hours on June 11, the Buffalo Fire Department was called to 428 Jersey Avenue after residents called 911 stating that part of the building had collapsed. Material from the building fell into the yards of at least three neighboring houses. Some of the bricks landed inside the building, while some fell into the yards of some houses behind homes on Richmond Avenue, leaving a 'V' shape. The city's preservation board held an emergency meeting today to discuss the issue. Wikinews has learned that the owner of the building, Bob Freudenheim, gave the city permission to demolish the building because he would not be \"rehabilitating the building anytime soon.\" Freudenheim was part-owner of the Hotel Lenox at 140 North Street in Buffalo and was also an advocate to stop the Elmwood Village Hotel from being built on the corners of Forest and Elmwood Avenues in 2006 and 2007, which Wikinews extensively covered. He also financially supported a lawsuit in an attempt to stop the hotel from being built. Though it is not known exactly how long Freudenheim has owned the stable, Wikinews has learned that he was the owner while fighting to stop the hotel from being built. Freudenheim has been facing housing violations due to the poor conditions of the building. \"We had a letter of violation against him. He was supposed to have started work to stabilize the brick this Monday. We all hope this building could be saved. But we've got five houses evacuated and we cannot tolerate any further delay. We've got to get people back into their homes in a safe condition,\" said Richard Tobe, Commissioner of the city's Permit and Inspection Services. Demolition on the building is expected to begin next week, but area residents are not happy and say they will fight to keep the building in place. \"They're going to have to trash our backyard to do it. So I hope they have to have our permission, because we're not going to give it lightly. I'm sure it's the biggest and architecturally significant livery stable still standing. I can't see any reason to take it down just because of one hole,\" stated Joe Murray, a resident on Richmond and Jersey who lives behind the collapsed portion of the building. Mike Lombardo, the Commissioner for the Buffalo Fire Department, believes that the building was built in 1812 or 1814, making it nearly 200 years old. It is one of only three stables still standing in the city. If the building is to be demolished, Freudenheim will end up paying the city nearly US$300,000 to get the job done."}, "4-58": {"heading": "Arizona may have driest winter in centuries ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Arizona_may_have_driest_winter_in_centuries", "date": "16-January-2006", "text": "Nearly a month into the Winter season, much of Arizona has still not received rain or snow.

The family was visiting a nearby waterfall when they were attacked. According to rescuers, the girl managed to escape from the bear, but was found only an hour later by a rescuer who fired shots that scared the bear away. \"Allegedly, after the rescue squad found the little girl, one of the squad members fired a shot from a small-caliber handgun. We don't know whether the bear was hit or not. There was no blood, but it chased off,\" said Dan Hicks, a spokesman for the states Wildlife Resources Agency. The mother and the brother both remain in critical condition at a hospital in Chattanooga. The boy's skull was punctured by a bite to the head, before the bear attacked his mother.

Witnesses say the fire was set by a gang of young men who poured fuel on the structure before setting it ablaze. Reporter Abjata Khalif of the Africa Pastoralist Journalists Network visited the scene.  He told VOA he counted 13 bodies lying in pools of blood within the Kenya Assemblies of God Pentacostal church in the village of Burnt Forest just a few kilometers outside Eldoret. \u201cThe attackers came and overran the entire church,\u201d he said.  \u201cThey broke down the doors and then broke the windows.  Several of the bodies I saw had big cuts; others were dismembered.\u201d [Many], who were in the church [originally] with the children and old people, ran for dear life [as the attack began] and left the others inside.\u201d Khalif said NGOs including the Red Cross are looking for those who successfully fled the church to identify the dead. Aid agencies also predict that there would be a \"humanitarian catastrophe,\" if problems in Kenya are not resolved soon. He says some politicians are calling for calm include the opposition MP for the area, William Ruto.  Khalif said Ruto, who was expected to be named prime minister if opposition candidate Raila Odinga were named president, \u201cmade an effort to calm down the [Kalinjin people, saying we\u2019re [trying] to solve the election [controversy] at international and national levels.\u201d  He said Ruto asked the public not to take part in acts of violence against life or property. Khalif said authorities are girding for more potential unrest because the opposition has called for a mass action at the grounds of Uhuru Park in Nairobi Thursday, despite government warnings that such actions are illegal.  He said up to two million people are expected. The attack in the Eldoret area pushed the death toll from the violence to about 275.

Local airline LAB had been operating the chartered passenger flight from La Paz to Cobija on behalf of Transporte Aereo Militar (TAM) when poor weather conditions caused the jet to be diverted. LAB has recently been handling excess passengers for TAM as an unusually severe rainy season has washed away many roads across the nation. A flight engineer said that during the flight the engines failed due to a mechanical problem. The plane came down in a swampy forest clearing approximately 2 miles (3.3km) from a runway at the new destination of Trinidad, 370 miles from the intended destination. Several passengers were injured in the accident, and all on board were taken to hospitals for checks. One pilot received a clavicle fracture. The plane was severely damaged, with the New York Times reporting that photographs of the scene showed at least one wing of the aircraft to have separated from the fuselage. Survivors confirmed this. Paolo Bravo, a Bolivian senator on board the plane, said to local radio network Erbol \"We noticed the engines went out, and there was this calm... Then they told us, 'Crash positions! crash positions!' and it was just another two or three seconds before we hit... The plane fell, the wings broke off, but the fuselage was OK.\" Experts from the Auxiliary Aerial Navigation Service and an airport commented that it is possible that the soft mus in the area absorbed some of the impact forces, allowing the plane to be salvaged and returned to service. LAB's operations chief Gustavo Viscarra made a statement saying \"The crew members did not suffer any problem and there is no blood... The airplane has minimum damages, there is no structural damage, there was not any fire nor smoke. It was a forced landing planned by the pilot and it was not caused by our enterprise's negligence nor lack of maintenance of our airplanes.\" Passenger numbers are unclear, with LAB reporting 151 and some media sources saying 155. An investigation has been launched. It has been established that an undisclosed technical problem prevented the plane from departing for an hour. Legal and financial difficulties have seen LAB suspend operations for almost a year, but the carrier has recently begun a limited return to charter services."}, "4-66": {"heading": "Temporary restraining order stops demolition of partially collapsed building in Buffalo, New York ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Temporary_restraining_order_stops_demolition_of_partially_collapsed_building_in_Buffalo,_New_York", "date": "15-June-2008", "text": "Buffalo, New York \u2014 During the early afternoon hours on June 11, the Buffalo Fire Department was called to scene at 428 Jersey Avenue after residents called 9-1-1 stating that part of a building had collapsed.

Some of the bricks landed inside the building, while some fell into the yards of some houses behind homes on Richmond Avenue, leaving a 'V' shape. According to savethelivery.com, a website set up and dedicated to \"saving part of this historic structure\", the restraining order was granted on Saturday, forcing demolition crews to halt their work. The site also states that court papers will be filed on Monday in an attempt to hold the owner Bob Freudenheim responsible for the damage done to the building, and surrounding properties.

Freudenheim gave the city permission to demolish the building on Thursday June 12 during an emergency Preservation Board meeting, because he would not be \"rehabilitating the building anytime soon.\" Freudenheim, along with his wife Nina, were part-owners of the Hotel Lenox at 140 North Street in Buffalo and were advocates to stop the Elmwood Village Hotel from being built on the corners of Forest and Elmwood Avenues in 2006 and 2007, which Wikinews extensively covered.

Residents state that Freudenheim should be \"100% responsible\" for his actions, and many are afraid that once the building is demolished, Freudenheim's charges of neglect will be abolished. Although a restraining order is in place, residents still fear that demolition crews will attempt to continue demolition.

This came as a surprise to residents, as demolition was not supposed to start until Monday June 16. During the early afternoon hours on June 11, the Buffalo Fire Department was called to scene after residents called 9-1-1 stating that part of the building had collapsed. Material from the building fell into the yards of at least three neighboring houses. Some of the bricks landed inside the building, while some fell into the yards of some houses behind homes on Richmond Avenue, leaving a 'V' shape. At about 3:30 p.m. crews began to demolish a small portion of the stable located behind Joe Murray's home, a resident who lives behind a portion of the building on Jersey and Richmond avenues. While demolition was taking place, the section collapsed into Murray's backyard, prompting a call to police. Some residents who own home surrounding the building were inside Murray's house holding a neighborhood meeting when demolition began. No one was injured when the section collapsed. \"[The building] can come down any minute,\" stated Donna Berry of the Buffalo Police Department who also added that when police arrived on scene, they immediately put a stop to demolition, fearing the safety of surrounding residents and pedestrians. \"So many [of the] people [living around the building] are at risk, it makes me want to cry,\" added Berry.

Tielman states that Freudenheim has offered to sell the building to any interested party for only one US dollar, but that he \"flip flops [his decision] constantly,\" sometimes wanting hundreds of thousands of dollars for the building. Wikinews has attempted to contact Freudenheim, but so far has been unsuccessful. City building inspectors were also on scene evaluating the building and ensuring the safety of residents. Donald Grezebielucina states that \"some people are on notice to vacate their properties\", but also stated that no other precautions were being taken other than placing \"tires and scaffolding\" onto the side of 430 Jersey, which sits less than eight feet from the buildings East side. \"The gas has been shut off in case we lost the building, so there would be no explosions or anything like that. It's so unstable, the structural integrity is gone. The chemical composite of the trusses has changed dramatically and dry rotted.

Officials say the crash, which occurred when the plane was approaching a Russian airport on Saturday, was due to dense fog, and that there are no survivors. The Polish Central Bank governor, Slawomir Skrzypek, and other members of the Polish government were amongst those onboard.  The crash was near Smolensk airport in western Russia. Kaczy\u0144ski's wife was killed along with him when the Tupolev Tu-154 went down; the trip to Russia was to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the Katyn massacre, when thousands of Polish prisoners of war and civilians were killed by the Soviets. Sergei Antufyev, the governor of the Smolensk area, said on Russian television that no one survived the crash; the claim was backed by Polish news agencies as well. \"As it was preparing for landing, the Polish president's aircraft did not make it to the landing strip,\" he commented. \"According to preliminary reports, it got caught up in the tops of trees, fell to the ground and broke up into pieces. There are no survivors in that crash. We are clarifying how many people there were in the [Polish] delegation. According to preliminary reports, 85 members of the delegation and the crew,\" he added.

However, a full flight manifest received from the Presidential Office has been published by several news portals, giving 96 as the number of killed in the crash, including eight members of the crew. The manifest is also available on the Office's official web page. Television footage showed the burning plane with its charred parts scattered in the forest where it crashed. The plane crashed approximately two kilometres (1.3 miles) from Smolensk airport. \"The plane caught fire after the crash. Teams began attempting to pull out passengers from the badly damaged airplane,\" commented a spokesman for the Polish Foreign Ministry from Warsaw. The chief of Poland's military force, Franciszek Gagor and Deputy Foreign Minister Andrzej Kremer were among the victims. A Polish television worker, Slawomir Wisniewski, said he was a witness to the crash, having seen it from hotel close by. \"I saw through the fog, the aeroplane flying very low with the left wing pointing to the ground. I heard something being broken and then that thudding sound. Two flashes of fire next to each other,\" he said, as quoted by the BBC. Polish Foreign Minister, Radoslaw Sikorski noted that the country \"could not have conceived a more horrible, poignant, tragic occurrence than our president going to commemorate the 70th anniversary of the murder of 20,000 Polish officers at Katyn himself dying.\" With the Polish president deceased, the speaker of the lower house of the parliament known as the Sejm, currently Bronislaw Komorowski, takes over as head of state, Komorowski's assistant Jerzy Smolinski told the Reuters news agency. Kaczy\u0144ski is survived by his daughter Marta and by his identical twin brother, Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski who was Prime Minister of Poland from 2006 to 2007 and is currently chairman of the Law and Justice Party he co-founded with Lech. Both brothers were child actors who starred in the 1962 film, The Two Who Stole the Moon. The Tupolev Tu-154, which was operated by the Polish Air Force, made its debut flight in 1990. 2,725 people have died in the 66 crashes involving this type of aircraft. According to the flight manifest, those on board included: Several other Polish government figures were in the plane as well. None of the passengers survived the crash. Poland has declared a week of national mourning after the incident. Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin was immediately appointed by Dmitry Medvedev, the president, as the head of the commission to investigate the crash. The latter also sent Sergei Shoigu, the Russian minister of emergency situations, to the site of the crash. Prime Minister of Poland Donald Tusk remarked that \"[w]e stand in the face of an incredible tragedy, one of the biggest tragic events of our nation's history. It is definitely the most tragic event in the post-war history of Poland.\" Russian President Dmitry Medvedev commented that \"All Russians are sharing in your grief and mourning. I promise that all the circumstances of this tragedy will be investigated most thoroughly, in closest cooperation with the Polish side. I have given exhaustive instructions to the law-enforcement agencies.\" He added, \"On behalf of the Russian people, I am expressing my deepest, most sincere condolences to the people of Poland, sympathy and support for the victims' families and friends.\" According to Medvedev, Monday the 12th will be a day of national mourning in Russia. British Prime Minister Gordon Brown, meanwhile, noted, \"I think the whole world will be saddened and in sorrow as a result of the tragic death in a plane crash of President Kaczynski and his wife Maria and the party that were with them.\" \"We know the difficulties that Poland has gone through, the sacrifices that he himself made as part of the Solidarity movement. We know the contribution he made to the independence and the freedom of Poland,\" he continued. French President Nicolas Sarkozy said of Kaczy\u0144ski, \"[He] devoted his life to his country. A tireless defender of the ideas in which he believed, he always battled with conviction for the values that founded his entry into politics: democracy, liberty and the fight against totalitarianism.\" German Chancellor Angela Merkel stated, \"This is a political and human tragedy for Poland, our neighbouring country. Lech Kaczy\u0144ski was a real lobbyist for his country, he loved his country and he was an argumentative European.\" Merkel also told of the memories she had of Kaczy\u0144ski, saying: \"I remember many meetings with him on European and international levels, in the end we always found a solution. I know that all of his life was dedicated to the fight for Poland's freedom and Europe's freedom. My husband and I fondly remember [his] invitation to his country house near Gdansk where we spent many, many hours talking about Polish and European history.\" US President Barack Obama made statement saying, \"Today, there are heavy hearts across America. The United States cherishes its deep and abiding bonds with the people of Poland. It is a testament to the strength of the Polish people that those who were lost were travelling to commemorate a devastating massacre of World War II as the leaders of a strong, vibrant, and free Poland.\" Obama added, \"That strength will ensure that Poland emerges from the depths of this unthinkable tragedy, and that the legacy of the leaders who died today will be a light that continues to guide Poland - and the world - in the direction of human progress.\" United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said, \"Kaczynski served his country and people with distinction and conviction, and was deservedly respected internationally. That he died en route to an event marking a new level of reconciliation between Poland and Russia is particularly poignant.\" Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd also expressed his condolences. \"The tragic death of president Kaczincki of Poland is a great loss to the people of the Polish Republic and of course to the government of the Polish Republic,\" he said. \"This has been an extraordinary tragedy involving the loss of  nearly 100 people.

Yudhoyono said that \"was under the same blue sky, exactly one year ago, that Mother Earth unleashed her most destructive power upon us, The assault began with a massive earthquake but ... that was only a prelude to the horrific catastrophe to come.\" In a live video address UN Secretary General Kofi Annan said \"The toughest time after last year's devastating tsunami may be yet to come, It was so brutal, so quick, so extensive that we are still struggling to fully comprehend it.\" Many of the survivors of the tsunami who live in the Andaman and Nicobar islands have yet to see significant benefits from international relief efforts.  Over 10,000 families are having to come to terms with the policies of their government.  Whilst local people would be happy to continue with traditional wood and bamboo materials, disputes see the government trying to impose higher standards. In Thailand, the anniversary of the massive wave sees tourists returning and reconstruction of resorts.  However, not all is so positive. Many who lost loved ones suffered from Post-traumatic stress disorder, and whilst 75% of those suffering are said to be recovered, those who still suffer may need life-long psychiatric help.  In  Phang-nga province, the hardest hit part of Thailand, there are around 300 people in that category, their symptoms including a deep-seated fear of the sea.  Binge drinking has also become a problem among many who lost everything, including family, when the disaster struck. In an attempt to focus on a recovery from the trauma inflicted on the children of Thailand, concerned parties have published a number of children's books aimed at rehabilitating.  Sponsored by the Canadian Embassy, The Day the Tsunami Came tells the tale of a boy who loses his father when the wave hit his fishing village in Phanag-nga province.  Its aim is to spread the message to those affected that they are not alone.  Apart from publication in Thai and English, the book will be available in Swedish, Dutch, Indonesian and Singhalese. Measures to prevent a recurrence of the massive casualties have been implemented in the year following the tsunami.  Earlier this month Thailand's tsunami early warning system passed its first official test.  National Disaster Warning Centre Director Plodprasop Suraswadi stated, \"Thailand is the first country in the region to successfully install a comprehensive tsunami early warning system. I believe the system can, from now on, save lives and assets of Thais and international tourists alike\".  The centre is due to be expanded in the coming year to cover \"natural disasters [such] as severe floods, forest fires and even air pollution.\"  Implementation of the tsunami warning system has not all gone according to plan.  Earlier in the month a false alarm caused by a technical error panicked tourists and local residents in the six provinces hit by the disaster, Krabi, Phang-nga Phuket, Ranong, Satun and Trang. Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra and a member of the royal family who lost her son were among those who spoke in the resort island of Phuket, the source of some of the most graphic footage of the incoming waves.  Thousands attended ceremonies held in Phuket and other affected parts of the country, observing periods of where flags were lowered to half-mast and bells rung in remembrance. Some villagers refused to take part saying the rites were expensive, inappropriate, events designed to attract tourists and showcase the government. Across Europe; hundreds joined in commemorating those who died. In Sweden, which suffered the highest loss of life for any country outside of Asia, official ceremonies were held, with more Swedes attended ceremonies in Thailand."}, "4-74": {"heading": "Wreckage of Kenya Airways flight 507 found in jungle; All 114 on board killed ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wreckage_of_Kenya_Airways_flight_507_found_in_jungle;_All_114_on_board_killed", "date": "7-May-2007", "text": "The latest information on the Kenya Airways information website states, \"Kenya Airways regrets to confirm that its Flight KQ 507 from Douala to Nairobi has been located on a mangrove swamp, 20 km southeast of Douala, on the planned flight path.\" The website also indicates that search and rescue operations have been initiated. There are no survivors. Flight KQ 507 had 8 crew members, 106 passengers and a flight engineer on board, and was traveling from Abidjan to Nairobi. It made a stopover in Douala, Cameroon where more passengers got on the plane before it continued on its flight. The plane sent a distress signal at 2:00 a.m., just after it took off from Cameroon, but it is not known what triggered the distress signal.

It left Abidjan at 11:05 p.m. local time in Nairobi. \"All I can say for now is that the wreckage of the plane has been located in the small village of Mbanga Pongo, in the Douala III subdivision. Access to the area is very difficult. We are beginning a new painful phase. Our task will be more difficult now, the task of recovering the corpses,\" said Hamidou Yaya Marafa, Cameroon's Minister of State for Territorial Administration, during a press conference. So far only small portions of the plane have been found, as much of the plane is reported to be underwater. \"The plane fell head first. Its nose was buried in the mangrove swamp,\" said chief of meteorology for the Douala airport, Thomas Sobakam. Reports say that many of the remains of the individuals on board the plane are dismembered and when rescuers attempt to recover the remains, they fall apart in their hands. \"It's devastating. I found one or two whole bodies at the start, but since then everything is in pieces. People were afraid of the bodies at the start, so I had to pick them up with my own hands, and they came apart in my fingers,\" said Captain of Cameroon's fire department, Francis Ekosso. There were passengers from 26 different countries on the plane, not including the 9 crew members from Kenya (see list below). Kenya Airways has released the names of all passengers on board Flight KQ 507 (see external links below). The area where the plane went down is reported to be thick with forest, and difficult to reach. Local Fisherman are said to have lead rescuers to the crash site after they heard a \"boom\" and saw \"disturbances in the water.\" \"We are told the aircraft was covered by a canopy of trees, and that was the delay in sighting the crash site. The mangrove area is a very tricky area, access is very difficult. I think they will use trekking and boats,\" added Marafa. Earlier the chief meteorologist for the airport in Douala, Cameroon, Thomas Sobakam said that \"signs\" of Flight KQ 507 were located, but also said that what was located was not wreckage. Sabakam also said that the reports that wreckage had been found were \"premature.\" The cause of the crash is under investigation, but officials say the plane took off in bad weather and are looking into whether engine failure played a role or not. At least one black box from the plane has been found, but its not known if it was the flight data recorder or the cockpit voice recorder.

The aircraft unfortunately has not arrived. The last message was received in Douala after takeoff and thereafter the tower was unable to contact the plane,\" CEO of Kenya Airways, Titus Naikuni said earlier in a statement. Reports say that the plane sent a distress signal at 2:00 a.m., just after it took off from Cameroon, but it is not known what triggered the distress signal. The plane was supposed to land at 6:15 a.m. local time. It left Abidjan at 11:05 p.m. local time in Nairobi. \"The distress call came from a machine, not a pilot. The latest information that a distress signal was picked up on the west coast of Africa and a search and rescue mission initiated by Cameroonian authorities was initiated at 1105 (0805GMT) this morning, that is Nairobi time. So far no report has been received from this mission,\" added Naikuni. The Cameroonian military is using helicopters to search the area around the Cameroonian capital Yaound\u00e9, near the town of Douala, Niete and Lolodorf. Ambulances in Lolodorf are ready to treat anyone they might find during the search. The plane is believed to be in an \"area [of] very dense forest,\" said Alfred Mutua, a spokesman for Kenya's government. The United States is also assisting in searching for the plane. Jim Proulx, a company spokesman for Boeing, said that the distress signal would have been activated \"in the event of a rapid change in velocity.\" Proulx also expressed his sympathies saying, \"we express our profound concern for the passengers and crew on board on the Kenya Airways flight that went missing.\" According to Kenya Airways, bad weather is causing delays in efforts to locate the plane and any possible wreckage. \"We are trying to get to the area of the crash, but the weather is really bad. We are getting help from the army,\" said Naikuni. Nothing was found during a search of the area by air on Saturday, but rescue workers are planning to resume the search Sunday morning. Because of the bad weather and heavy rains, the search has only been concentrated in the air. Witnesses from towns near where the signal is being reported say that they heard a \"large boom\" and then saw a \"flash of fire.\" According to a Kenya Airways news release, a crisis management center in Embakasi, a location close to the airport, was setup to monitor the situation and additional details will be provided when received. Relatives of those on board the plane are being asked to stay at that location and wait for further details. Despite the search, the TurkishPress.com, which quotes AFP, an unnamed official says that they have located the wreckage. \"The plane has crashed. We have located the plane ... and we cannot talk about it,\" said the unnamed official with the Kenyan Civil Aviation Authority. Despite the AFP's report, Naikuni says he cannot confirm that the plane has crashed or if anything was found. \"Until we see the plane -- until then, it's missing.\" Naikuni also added that the distress signal could have been triggered by something other than a crash. The last Kenya Airways flight to crash was on January 30, 2000.  Flight 431 was traveling from Abidjan to Lagos when it crashed into the Atlantic Ocean during bad weather. 179 people were on board and 10 survived.

Save The Livery is comprised of concerned area residents who have grown to love the building's historic and unique character. On June 14, they won a temporary restraining order to stop demolition. The court ruled that the city was only allowed to remove material in immediate danger to residents and pedestrians, but stated that the demolition could only be performed with \"hand tools.\" The court also ordered that any rubble which had fallen into neighboring yards when the building collapsed, to be removed. \"It is in the interest of the city to have a safe environment--but also important to maintain a sense of historical preservation,\" stated Burns in his ruling. Burns has given the sides until tomorrow (Friday June 20) to come to an agreement and has ordered both parties to return to court at 9:30 a.m. (eastern time) \"sharp.\" Activists of Save The Livery urge supporters of the stable to \"fill the courtroom\" to show \"continued and ongoing support.\" The hearing is scheduled to take place at 25 Delaware Avenue in the Supreme Court building, 3rd Floor, trial part 19. Currently the building is owned by Bob Freudenheim who has several building violations against him because of the buildings poor condition. He has received at least five violations in three months and residents who live near the building state that Freudenheim should be \"100% responsible\" for his actions. Many are afraid that if the building is demolished, Freudenheim's charges of neglect will be abolished. On June 17, developer and CEO of Savarino Companies, Sam Savarino was at the site of the stable, discussing the building with residents and preservationists. In 2006, Savarino proposed and planned The Elmwood Village Hotel, a 'botique' hotel on the Southeast corner of Elmwood and Forest Avenues. The project was later withdrawn after residents filed a lawsuit against Savarino and the city. Wikinews extensively covered the story, and contacted Savarino for his professional opinion on the building. \"[I would] love to see it preserved. I was there to see if there was anything we could do to help, to see if anything can be salvaged. I just want to see the right thing happen, and so does the city,\" stated Savarino to Wikinews who added that he was allowed inside the building for a brief period. \"The side walls are beyond repair. The roof has rotted and it could come down at any time,\" added Savarino who also said that the building \"below the second floor appears to be stable.\" He also states that the back wall of the building, which borders several homes, appears to be intact. \"Eliminating the back wall could be a problem for the neighbors. It is not unreasonable to leave at least 12 feet\" of the back wall standing, added Savarino. Savarino did not say if he was interested in buying the property, but did state, \"I am sure there are  a couple of people interested\" in buying the property. On Thursday, Buffalo News reported that a \"businessman\" might be interested in purchasing the property, though Wikinews is not able to independently confirm the report. Savarino says that with the property still slated for emergency demolition, a potential buyer could face tax fees of nearly US$300,000. Freudenheim gave the city permission to demolish the building on Thursday June 12 during an emergency Preservation Board meeting, because he would not be \"rehabilitating the building anytime soon.\" Freudenheim, along with his wife Nina, were part-owners of the Hotel Lenox at 140 North Street in Buffalo and were advocates to stop the Elmwood Village Hotel. They also financially supported a lawsuit in an attempt to stop the hotel from being built. Though it is not known exactly how long Freudenheim has owned the stable, Wikinews has learned that he was the owner while fighting to stop the hotel from being built. Residents say that he has been the owner for at least 22 years. The building was first owned by a company called White Bros. and was used as a stable for a farm which once covered the land around the building for several blocks. The Buffalo Fire Department believes the building was built around 1814, while the city property database states it was built in 1870. Servants and workers of the farm were housed inside resident quarters situated at the rear of the building on what is now Summer Street, but are now cottages where area residents currently reside. Some date as far back as 1829. At about 1950, the stable was converted into an automobile body shop and gasoline station.A property record search showed that in 1950 at least four fuel storage tanks were installed on the property. Two are listed as 550 square feet while the other two are 2,000 square feet. All of the tanks are designated as a TK4, which New York State says is used for \"below ground horizontal bulk fuel storage.\" The cost of installing a tank of that nature according to the state, at that time, included the tank itself, \"excavation and backfill,\" but did not include \"the piping, ballast, or hold-down slab orring.\" It is not known if the tanks are still on the property, but residents are concerned the city was not taking the precautions to find out."}, "4-78": {"heading": "City to sue owner of partially collapsed 19th century livery in Buffalo, New York ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/City_to_sue_owner_of_partially_collapsed_19th_century_livery_in_Buffalo,_New_York", "date": "24-June-2008", "text": "Buffalo, New York \u2014 On June 11, a significant portion of the stable's right side wall collapsed into the yard of a resident's home. Authorities, including the Buffalo Fire Department were called to the scene to evaluate the collapse and evacuate 15 homes of residents surrounding the stable as a precautionary measure. The following day, the city ordered an emergency demolition on the building, which was stopped by a restraining order residents with Save The Livery (www.savethelivery.com) won on June 14. Two weeks later, five homes are still evacuated and residents don't know when they will be able to return. On June 19, Judge Justice Christopher Burns of the New York State Supreme Court ordered a halt to the emergency demolition and ordered the city and residents to come to an agreement to save the building, or at least a significant portion of it. Despite a court date today, no agreement has yet been reached between the two parties. \"It is in the interest of the city to have a safe environment--but also important to maintain a sense of historical preservation,\" stated Burns in his June 19th ruling. The court ruled that a limited demolition could take place and that the city was only allowed to remove material in immediate danger to residents and pedestrians, but stated that the demolition could only be performed with \"hand tools.\" The court also ordered that any rubble which had fallen into neighboring yards when the building collapsed, to be removed. Since then, most of not all the significantly damaged portions of the building or portions in immediate danger of falling have been demolished. The roof has also been removed to put less stress on the stable's walls. \"Its been over three years since we have been having problems with part of the livery falling down. There was an implosion two weeks ago and suddenly the city wanted to have an emergency demolition,\" said Catherine Herrick who lives on Summer Street immediately behind the stable and is the main plaintiff in the lawsuit against the city. Many homes on Summer are small cottages which were used as servants quarters when the stable was in operation, many of which were built in the 1820's. At least seven homes on Summer border the stable's back walls. Residents in those homes have significant gardens which have been planted against the building and growing for decades. \"Both parties are to continue to work together to see how we can meet everybody's needs. This is the third time we have been in that courtroom, and that is what we were basically told to do,\" added Herrick who said the rally was held today because this \"is Buffalo's history. Buffalo is a wonderful place to live because of its history and this is a historical, beautiful building and we need to keep those beautiful buildings.\" Herrick states that the city is working with residents, but also believes that its \"slow moving\" and they are allowing the owner to get away with neglect on the property. \"I believe right now that they are letting the owner get off. The owner was negligent for 20 years, and hasn't done anything to it despite what he has claimed to say. Now that this is an emergency situation, the city has a lot to say about it,\" added Herrick.

Residents say that he has been the owner for at least 22 years. Attorneys for Freudenheim confirm that the city is starting proceedings against him for his violations beginning as early as Wednesday June 25. Freudenheim has not released a statement and could not be reached for comment. Many residents want the building preserved and Herrick states that their engineer can have it stable in \"four days\" as opposed to the 14-30 days it would take to demolish the building and \"at a lesser cost than what it costs to demolish it.\" It will cost the city nearly US$300,000 to demolish the building which is paid for with tax money collected from residents in the city. The Buffalo News reports that fees are approaching $700,000. Though reports say there is a potential buyer of the stable, Wikinews cannot independently confirm those reports. Residents say the stable was designed by Richard A. Waite, a 19th century architect, and was first owned by a company called White Bros., used as a stable and housed at least 30 horses at any given time. It also stored \"coaches, coupes, broughams, Victorias  and everything in the line of light livery,\" stated an article from the West Side Topics dated 1906. According to the article, The company first opened in 1881 on Thirteenth Street, now Normal Avenue, and later moved into the Jersey building in 1892. The Buffalo Fire Department believes the building was built around 1814, while the city property database states it was built in 1870. It is believed to be only one of three stables of this kind still standing in the country. At about 1950, the stable was converted into an automobile body shop and gasoline station.A property record search showed that in 1950 at least four fuel storage tanks were installed on the property.

Wikinews has called the city along with the Mayor's office several times, but both have yet to return our calls. There are conflicting reports as to the date of the next hearing. According to Herrick, the next hearing is July 1, 2008 though the Buffalo News states the next hearing is July 8.

It features original material compiled throughout the previous month after an overview of the month's biggest stories. This month's spotlight on the campaign trail: the Libertarian Party's presidential nominee secures ballot access in all 50 U.S. states, the Unity Party of America presidential nominee proposes a novel solution to the issue of \"packing\" the U.S. Supreme Court, and three candidates give their thoughts on the latest military conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan. As the campaign entered September, Democratic Party presidential nominee Joe Biden led President Donald Trump, the Republican Party presidential nominee, in the RealClearPolitics head-to-head polling average, 49.0 percent to 43.0 percent. President Trump started the month visiting Kenosha, Wisconsin, where riots had broken out due to the police shooting of Jacob Blake in August.  Trump referred to the riots as acts of \"domestic terror\" and placed further emphasis on maintaining \"law and order.\" His opponent, Biden, in a message to fundraisers, accused Trump of \"trying to scare the hell out of America.\"  Biden himself visited Kenosha two days after Trump in what was his first campaign trip to the swing state of Wisconsin.  During the appearance, Biden delivered a speech on racial inequality while wearing a mask, discussing the \"original sin\" of slavery.  He also visited the family of Jacob Blake and spoke to Blake on the phone.  The Trump campaign criticized Biden for not denouncing Antifa and for making the trip despite claiming previously that it was not safe to do so due to the coronavirus pandemic.  Wisconsin governor Tony Evers, a Democrat, said he would have preferred that neither Trump nor Biden had made the stop. At least three unfavorable claims about Trump surfaced in early September.  First, after CNN reporter and former Bill Clinton White House Press Secretary Joe Lockhart questioned whether the President's impromptu visit to Walter Reed Hospital last November was the result of a stroke, Trump alleged the media was falsely claiming he had suffered from \"mini-strokes.\"  Thereafter, Matt Drudge posted a report from The Hill about Trump's \"mini-strokes\" tweet as the top story on the Drudge Report. Trump attacked Drudge as a consistent Trump opponent and his campaign called for CNN to fire Lockhart.  Next, The Atlantic claimed that during a 2018 trip to France, Trump refused to visit a cemetery of U.S. soldiers killed during the World War I Battle of Belleau Wood and referred to the soldiers buried there as \"losers\" and \"suckers.\"  Furthermore, Trump allegedly questioned whether the U.S. allied with the correct side during the war.  Aides publicly denied the story as did Trump-critic and former National Security Advisor John Bolton.  Nevertheless, others, including Fox News reporter Jennifer Griffin, confirmed key parts of the story.  Trump called on Fox News to fire Griffin. Lastly, excerpts from Bob Woodward's book Rage, for which Trump gave insider access, revealed Trump downplayed the coronavirus in February in order to avoid public panic.  Trump confirmed the claim, arguing it was not in the national interest to stir up panic about the virus.   Biden, while campaigning in Michigan, called Trump's action \"a life-and-death betrayal of the American people.\"  He described it as \"beyond despicable\" and \"almost criminal.\" In mid-September, Trump held his first indoor rally in three months, in Nevada, flouting local coronavirus mandates.  Afterwards Trump visited California to discuss the wildfires wreaking havoc in the state.  In a public briefing that included California governor Gavin Newsom, Trump denied the effect of climate change on the intensity of the fires, arguing they were largely the product of forest mismanagement.  The climate change issue reappeared on the campaign trail.  Biden delivered a speech in Delaware in which he called Trump a \"climate arsonist,\" citing the recent California wildfires, flooding and Atlantic hurricanes.  He argued that if Trump wins re-election, \"these hellish events will continue to become more common.\" In Florida, where hurricanes have a disproportionate impact, polls revealed Trump strengthening with Latinos; perhaps due, League of United Latin American Citizens president Domingo Garcia indicated, to Trump's social conservative positions and stances against socialism and protests.  As Kamala Harris visited the state and focused more on the African American constituency, Biden campaign officials expressed concern about Latino support.  Biden improved his standing among another large voting bloc in Florida, senior citizens, who voted heavily for Trump in 2016.  Furthermore, a major boost for Biden in Florida came with the announcement that former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg planned to invest US$100 million into the state and offered to pay fines for former inmates to regain their ability to vote. Trump claimed the move was criminal. Building on the deal brokered between Israel and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) the previous month, the Trump administration announced additional deals between Israel and Bahrain and between Serbia, Kosovo, and Israel.  Like the UAE, the Muslim majority nations of Bahrain and Kosovo recognized Israel and opened diplomatic relations with the nation. The formerly antagonistic nations of Serbia and Kosovo opened economic ties as well and Serbia agreed to move its embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. Representatives from the UAE, Bahrain, and Israel held a special signing at the White House with President Trump.  Trump hailed the agreements as the \"dawn of a new Middle East.\"  Meanwhile, the conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan over the disputed Nagorno-Karabakh region escalated to violence. Back home, Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died, leaving an opening on the Court.  Democrats claimed the election should decide who picks the next justice, citing the Republicans' refusal to consider President Barack Obama's nomination of Merrick Garland after the death of Antonin Scalia in 2016.  Republicans argued this was a different situation than in 2016 because now the party controlling the Senate matches the President's party.  President Trump nominated Federal Judge Amy Coney Barrett for the seat.  Citing concerns Barrett's placement would upset the balance of the Court for conservatives, some Democrats advocated packing the Court with liberal justices until it reached a liberal majority.  That would only be possible if Democrats won the presidency and the Senate.  When confronted with the possibility of Democrats winning the election, Trump would not commit to a peaceful transfer of power, claiming the possibility of fraud occurring as a result of increased mail-in voting. Trump received criticism for the statement.  Republican Senator Mitt Romney, a sometime Trump critic, said the peaceful transfer of power is what separates the U.S. from nations like Belarus, and described Trump's potential unwillingness as \"unthinkable and unacceptable.\" The Biden campaign recycled a statement it first put out in July:  \"The American people will decide this election. And the United States government is perfectly capable of escorting trespassers out of the White House.\" Trump received further criticism just ahead of the first presidential debate,  when The New York Times published allegations about his tax returns.  The reports indicated Trump paid US$750 in taxes in 2016 and the same amount in 2017, and that he owed on loans in excess of US$300 million due in four years.  Trump labeled the report as \"fake news\" and said he would release his tax returns once he was no longer under audit.  Biden left the campaign trail a few days before the debate to prepare both virtually and in-person at his Delaware house. According to CNN, a source told them Trump prepared for a total of two hours, enlisting help from former New Jersey governor Chris Christie and former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani.  He continued to hold campaign rallies and White House events. The first presidential debate between Trump and Biden took place on the penultimate day of September in Ohio. During the debate, the candidates often interrupted each other.  Although Biden was the first to do so, Trump interrupted far more often.  Moderator Chris Wallace was criticized for his inability to maintain control. During the debate, Biden would not say whether or not he supported Court packing.  Once, when Trump interjected, Biden said \"Will you Shut up, man?\"  During the course of the debate, Biden called Trump a clown, a racist, and the worst president.  Trump insulted Biden as unintelligent. After Biden attacked Trump for the alleged \"losers\" and \"suckers\" comment reported in The Atlantic, Trump brought up Biden's son Hunter Biden and his dealings in Ukraine and China.  Biden defended his son's struggle with drugs. Biden attacked Trump for the over 200,000 U.S. deaths from coronavirus. Trump countered that Biden would have lost even more if he were president due to his opposition to the travel ban from China. Trump claimed Democrats pushed Biden to the far left on socialized medicine, the Green New Deal and defunding the Police. Biden referred to himself as the Democratic Party and said he did not support the policies Trump mentioned. Trump argued Biden had just lost the far left by saying he didn't support those things.  He challenged Biden to name any law enforcement individuals or groups who endorsed Biden's campaign, which Biden did not do. Trump made a confusing statement about the far right organization Proud Boys, when asked to condemn them, stating \"stand back and stand by\" but argued the far left Antifa organization needed to be addressed.  Biden called Antifa an \"idea.\"  Trump continued his claims about postal voting causing fraud and again would not commit to accepting the results of the election. After the debate, CNN anchor Dana Bash described the event as a \"shitshow.\" Republican Senator Ben Sasse had the same response. Fox News commentator Ari Fleischer called it \"a mess.\"  Biden called Trump a \"national embarrassment\" for his performance, while the communications director for the Trump campaign, Tim Murtaugh, declared victory for Trump.  According to the Commission on Presidential Debates, moderators would have \"additional tools\" to maintain order in future debates. As September came to a close, Biden maintained his lead over President Trump in the RealClearPolitics head-to-head polling average, 49.7 percent to 43.1 percent. Libertarian Party presidential candidate Jo Jorgensen passed a milestone in September, becoming the only third party candidate in this election to secure ballot access in all states and the District of Columbia.  The party had the same access in 2016, but in that cycle there was no coronavirus pandemic hampering petitioning efforts.  Before 2016, the last time the Libertarian Party had ballot access in all jurisdictions was 1996 when Jorgensen was on the ballot as the running mate of the late Harry Browne.  The Browne-Jorgensen ticket, as well as the Reform Party ticket of the late Ross Perot that same year, was the last time before 2016 that any third party or independent candidate achieved full ballot access. In a celebratory email to supporters, Jorgensen exclaimed: \"It's official \u2014 my campaign is on ballot in ALL 50 states!  I want to thank all the volunteers and staff who made this possible. It was a lot of work! We're talking about hours upon hours of collecting petitions.\" With the access secured, Jorgensen aimed to gain entry to the presidential debates sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates.  The Commission's  criterion for inclusion remains a showing of 15 percent support in opinion polls.  In late September polls, when included, Jorgensen was in third place. \u00a0She drew two percent in the September 25\u201327 L\u00e9ger poll, two percent in the September 26\u201327 Redfield & Wilton Strategies survey, and five percent in the September 25\u201327 Zogby Analytics poll. \"We are the real choice for American voters in November,\" Jorgensen argued, \"yet the corrupt Commission on Presidential Debates refuses to have me. Our campaign is the only viable option to both Trump or Biden.\" In 2016, despite full ballot access and a lawsuit against the Commission on Presidential Debates, then-Libertarian presidential nominee Gary Johnson was denied access to the debates.  Nevertheless, he received 3.27 percent of the vote on Election Day, the most a Libertarian Party presidential nominee has ever received. In mid-September, staunch liberal Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died after a long battle with cancer.  President Trump nominated conservative Amy Coney Barrett as her replacement.  With a Republican majority in the U.S. Senate, Barrett's confirmation was likely, resulting a 6\u20133 majority for conservatives in the Court.  In response, some Democrats, such as former 2020 presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg, the former mayor of South Bend, Indiana, proposed major changes to the Court, similar to what President Franklin Delano Roosevelt proposed in the 1930s.  While Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden did not say in the debate whether he supports significant changes, one third party presidential nominee proposed to Wikinews a novel approach, aiming both to prevent future Court packing and promote ideological balance. After his New Deal programs suffered a series of defeats in the Supreme Court, President Roosevelt looked to add justices that would interpret the Constitution to uphold his agenda.  Capitalizing on the public perception of the Court as being too old, Roosevelt sought to tie the number of justices to age. In 1937, he proposed a bill to amend the Judiciary Act of 1869, which sets the number of Supreme Court justices at nine. Now, 83 years later, some Democrats have revisited a plan to expand the number of justices that Buttigieg proposed during his campaign.  He suggested expanding the Court to 15 justices: five Republicans, five Democrats, and five to be chosen by the other justices. Other Democratic plans include a straight-up expansion of the number of justices and a plan to institute term limits for justices.  According to a 2019 Marquette University poll, 57 percent of the U.S. public opposes expanding the number of justices. However, 72 percent support term limits. Bill Hammons, 2020 presidential nominee of the Unity Party of America, whose running mate Eric Bodenstab spoke to Wikinews in August, provided Wikinews with his own plan for the Court. \u00a0While it would expand the number of justices, it aims to prevent future Court packing: \"The number of Justices should be set at 13 with a Constitutional Amendment to prevent future Court Packing,\" says Hammons, \"and the four new Justices should be smart non-ideologues who have been ignored for their lack of ideology.\" The U.S. Constitution provides two ways to propose a Constitutional Amendment as Hammons proposes: (1) a two-thirds affirmative vote in the Senate and House of Representatives, or (2) an affirmative vote in the state legislatures of two-thirds of the states to call a constitutional convention.  The latter route has not yet been used. If an amendment is successfully proposed, three-quarters of states must then ratify it in order for the amendment to become part of the Constitution.  The last successful amendment occurred in 1992. While both the Hammons plan and the Buttigieg plan aim for balance, Hammons's approach differs from Buttigieg's in that future Court packing, like that proposed from President Roosevelt, would not be possible absent further amendment to the Constitution.  Furthermore, there is no partisan classification of justices provided and party identification does not serve as the basis for judicial ideology. Curiously, the number of justices Hammons favors matches the current number of U.S. circuit courts; the courts from which the Supreme Court hears appeals. A longstanding conflict between the nations of Armenia and Azerbaijan erupted into violence late in September.  The conflict between the two Post-Soviet states centers on the Nagorno-Karabakh region.  It lies within the internationally-recognized borders of Azerbaijan but the Armenian-backed separatist Republic of Artsakh currently occupies it. After inquiry from Wikinews, U.S. presidential candidates Phil Collins of the Prohibition Party, Don Blankenship of the Constitution Party, and Jo Jorgensen of the Libertarian Party, weighed in on the issue. Armenia and Azerbaijan fought a war over the Nagorno-Karabakh region in 1994.   Russia brokered a cease-fire agreement but skirmishes continued to break out.  The latest violence began with conflicting claims from both sides. The Armenians claim they were retaliating against missile attacks from Azerbaijan.  The Azerbaijanis state they were responding to Armenian aggression.  The president of Turkey vowed support for Azerbaijan, while Russia called for a cessation of fighting.  As of September 30, Armenia claimed 790 Azerbaijani soldiers had been killed, with 103 Artsakh deaths. Azerbaijan claimed to have killed about 2,300 Artsakh soldiers. President Trump commented on the matter during a White House Press Briefing, \"[W]e're looking at it very strongly. [...] We have a lot of good relationships in that area. We'll see if we can stop it.\"  Although Trump's State Department asked for any \"external party\" not to involve themselves in the conflict, his main presidential rival Joe Biden called on the President to demand directly that Turkey stop interfering on Azerbaijan's behalf. Collins saw compromise as the best way for the two nations to resolve their differences: \"I think that those countries should compromise and split the disputed area in half.\" Nevertheless, Collins did not want the U.S. to involve itself militarily and calls on Washington to remain neutral. His opponents, Jorgensen and Blankenship, shared this view. \"The conflict between Armenia and Azerbaijan is their conflict. Not ours\", said Jorgensen. \"We have no business taking either side. Our foreign policy should resemble one giant Switzerland, armed and neutral.\" Blankenship concurred: \"We need to stop policing the world and allow other countries to manage their own affairs\", he argued. \"We need to withdraw our troops from all but a very few foreign countries. Armenia and Azerbaijan should be given the freedom to solve their own issues. \" There is precedent for the U.S. President mediating international disputes. In 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt mediated a peace agreement between Japan and Russia, fostering the treaty that ended the Russo-Japanese War.  Roosevelt's efforts earned him the Nobel Peace Prize.  President Jimmy Carter mediated an end to the conflict between Israel and Egypt at the Camp David Accords in 1978 that brought about the 1979 Egypt\u2013Israel peace treaty and the normalization of relations between the two nations.  The Norwegian Nobel Committee cited this in awarding Carter the 2002 Peace Prize.  And President Trump, in September 2020, addressed the Arab\u2013Israeli conflict in mediating the Abraham Accords that normalized relations between Israel and the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain."}, "4-80": {"heading": "Wikinews interviews Democratic candidate for the Texas 6th congressional district special election Daryl Eddings, Sr's campaign manager ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikinews_interviews_Democratic_candidate_for_the_Texas_6th_congressional_district_special_election_Daryl_Eddings,_Sr%27s_campaign_manager", "date": "20-April-2021", "text": "Wikinews extended invitations by e-mail on March 23 to multiple candidates running in the Texas' 6th congressional district special election  of May 1 to fill a vacancy left upon the death of Republican congressman Ron Wright.  Of them, the office of Democrat Daryl Eddings, Sr. agreed to answer some questions by phone March 30 about their campaigns and policies.  The following is the interview with Ms Chatham on behalf of Mr Eddings, Sr. Eddings is a federal law enforcement officer and senior non-commissioned officer in the US military.  His experience as operations officer of an aviation unit in the California National Guard includes working in Los Angeles to control riots sparked by the O. J. Simpson murder case and the police handling of Rodney King, working with drug interdiction teams in Panama and Central America and fighting in the Middle East.  He is the founder of Operation Battle Buddy, which has under his leadership kept in touch with over 20 thousand veterans and their families.  He was born in California, but moved to Midlothian, Texas. He endeavours to bring \"good government, not no government\".  Campaign manager Faith Chatham spoke to Wikinews on matters ranging from healthcare to housing. An Inside Elections poll published on March 18 shows Republican candidate Susan Wright, the widow of Ron Wright, is ahead by 21% followed by Democrat Jana Sanchez with 17% and Republican Jake Ellzey with 8% with a 4.6% margin of error among 450 likely voters.  The district is considered \"lean Republican\" by Inside Elections and voted 51% in favour of Donald Trump in last year's US presidential election.  This is down from 54% for Trump in 2016's presidential election, the same poll stated. Could you please introduce Mr Eddings and his history more broadly? ((Faith Chatham))  Okay. Daryl J. Eddings Sr is a retired senior non-commissioned officer.  He has 26 years of military experience, and then part of that time he was also working for the US federal government.  So, he had 30 years of federal law enforcement experience, and he's only 60 so that's pretty incredible.  He's a highly decorated veteran; we can't talk about this really ((*))Clarification from Faith Chatham: \u200dA news story can mention the medals including the purple heart but for adv[ert] purposes a campaign cannot mention them without prior approval of the Pentagon.  We are instructed to refer to his decoration as \"highly decorated senior non commissioned officer retired\"., but if you look at his uniform, there's not even a place to put another medal!  Just about anything you could give him from a Purple Heart, he has earned.  He lives in Midlothian, Texas.  His family ties, his dad's family, goes back six generations, but he says by an accident of birth he was born in California.  So, he graduated from high school in California and went immediately into the military.  And then, when he came out of the military, he became a single father and so he went back to California where his children were.  And went into the National Guard in California and, at the same time he went to work for the US federal service.  So, with the US federal service he was the non-commissioned officer, operations officer, on the back \u2014 he wasn't the commander of the plane, but he was the person that was in-command of everybody on the plane with US national service. So he had fourteen deputies under him, and then he was supervising people on three different federal agencies.  He basically, I found he'll say \"oh, I was in the military\" and then when I peel it down and I peel it down it's so much more complex.  There is a time he basically went back to California thinking he'd be closer to his kids, but that was during the George Bush years.  And if you remember what happened to people who go into the National Guard during that period of time, he was deported more during that period of time than otherwise.  He was sent to Panama on drug interdiction, he patrolled the US southern border on drug interdiction and he was the operations commander for emergency management with the state of California while he was there. He was the senior non-commissioned officer reporting to a one-star general during the Rodney King riot, the O. J. Simpson riot, earthquakes, forest fires.  He supervised an aviation unit that flew to this big state, you know, surveying it for wars, he was responsible for moving troops and equipment and people and personnel.  And also his team was directly responsible for the security of the governor and the mayor and their staff during the O. J. Simpson and the Rodney King riots.  So, he has an incredibly wide range of experience. In his foreign deployments, and he's been deployed all over the world, he was the provost marshal in Iraq, and there was a tactical team that was under his command that was looking for the top generals of the Revolutionary Guard, you know, right after Saddam [Hussein] and you know, that kind of stuff.  He was being a provost marshal, it was the equivalent of being the police chief over a city of 50 thousand and a 75 mile (121 kilometre) radius.  So, he's always been the person that was responsible for the people above him and below him.  He's always been the person that they went to to find solutions.  Whatever was needed, he was the one that was supposed to figure out how to get it and how to take care of it, and this is what he continues to do. ((WN))  What would he consider the powers of the US representative? ((Faith Chatham))  The power of the US representative, in his thing, is the ability to deliver for the people what they need.  He thinks that what most people are doing is not really, you know, that's not really; it upsets him to see so many of our representatives representing a very small number of people instead of really looking out for the majority of the people.  He takes very seriously; he decided to run, he'd been thinking about it for a long time but he made up his mind January 6, because he doesn't believe that there are, he believes that there are too many in Congress that don't understand what their oath of office is.  They don't understand that their loyalty is to the Constitution of the United States, not to any one person or a party. He knows that there were too many of them up there that are applauding what [Donald] Trump did, and are saying that it was just a demonstration, or it was just a riot.  And he's been in riots; he knows what a riot is and he knows this was an insurrection.  He believes very truthfully that one of the greatest powers that we have is the power to vote, and this was an attempt to abridge the right of people to vote.  And so, a person that's in Congress is a representative of the people that have elected them. And that's the power: the people are the power.  We've lost it, it's been lost because of dark money and gerrymandering and many things in that area.  And there's many attempts right now to abridge the vote even further.  And so, he really feels like that we have got to regain more of the seats so that we can protect what he and his friends have fought so hard and given so much to give us, you know. So, that's, I guess that's about as good of an answer I know I can give for him.  We've been through this stuff so much now, I've almost got to memorise it. ((WN))  Alright.  He's running as a Democrat in a house district which is controlled by Republicans since... ((Faith Chatham))  He is a life-long Democrat, he's been very active in the Democratic Party; he was the chief of staff and the security officer for Dr Shirley McKellar who ran three times against Louie Gohmert down in East Texas, and he helped to organise East Texas, and he was very much in favour of Hillary Clinton, and so he was working to try to help, you know get out the vote for Hillary during those years that we was working down there.  And he's participated in the state convention and in the national conventions for the Democratic Party. ((WN))  Alright, well, my question was he's running as a Democrat in a house district which has been controlled by Republicans since 1983, it's being contested by the Republicans and the Libertarians and an independent.  Why do you think Texans would choose a Democrat this time? ((Faith Chatham))  This district has been going purple.  In 2014, we made a turn in that district.  In fact, the Tarrant County \u2014 Tarrant County is the largest part of the district, and it is now purple.  The two smaller, in fact the last three elections the Democrats would have won if it hadn't been for the Republicans in the small rural counties of Navarro and Ellis.  He lives in Midlothian, and that's the part of the county that is \u2014 Ellis County \u2014 that's been turning blue, and he has a lot of support in that part.  And the Democrats that are running are not running against each other; they're running together.  And they're not in there attacking each other, they're basically running together, and so the district has been turning steadily blue.  There's enough people that are, there's been, you know, it's a matter of building infrastructure.  You build political infrastructure year after year after year, and I believe they really began building that political infrastructure in 2012 in that district, and it's been by certain, it's been by candidates that have run and lost, but they have put certain things in place that the next one can deal with.  And so, there's a possibility.  It's not a done deal. But this district, in case you remember, this is a district that Phil Gramm; Phil Gramm was a Republican who went to work for \u2014 he lost, he ran for Congress as a Republican and lost, he went to work for a Democrat.  Then, he ran as a Democrat and won, and then he immediately went in and partnered with Ronald Reagan to get trickle-down economics passed.  And, he made Tip O'Neill mad, and he pulled him off of all of his committees, and he took his marbles and became a Republican, it's been Republican ever since.  Trickle-down economics has not worked in that district.  The district, especially the two rural counties have got poorer and poorer ever since that happened, and one of the things that really caused that is that trickle-down economics and also the GOP tax cuts that had no-strings-attached meant that companies no longer invested in employees' education and training.  They no longer had to invest in upgrading their infrastructure, on upgrading their own [...] on investing here in America.  We lost American jobs, and Ellis and Navarro counties are two counties where they really have lost a lot of jobs.  And, there's been a lot of things that have happened in that district: the housing costs have gone up rapidly, they have less access to healthcare. So, there's been a real price.  Now, there's also Joe Barton, who was of course Phil Gramm's prot\u00e9g\u00e9, and Ron Wright was Joe Barton's chief of staff during a large part of the time that Joe was on the Energy Committee.  And the main thing Joe did was protect the energy companies.  And here in January, we had a very bad storm here, and the protection that had been given to the energy companies really meant that a lot of Texans really lost their life, and many others basically lost, you know, were out in the cold literally; because they didn't force them to winterise, they set up a scheme to where if they didn't produce the energy \u2014 if you don't deliver energy you can profiteer and charge much higher rates. So, some people are waking up on this.  There's also, there are people that are very staunch, this particular race in particular, you have a real divide between those that are all for Donald Trump and those that aren't.  All twelve of the Republicans voted for Donald Trump in November.  There's only one out of the twelve that says he no longer deserves to be the leader of the party because of January 6.  So, you have a real agreement on Trump's policies, and you also have a great many of them that really believe that the insurrection was just right, you know it was just fine and dandy.  There are a lot of people that don't believe that, and so that's basically what we're saying, you know, is that there's a difference in, and there's a difference in ideology, there's a difference in thought. Now, no one can say that he's anti-law enforcement because he is law enforcement.  No one can say he's anti-military because he is military.  He's not anti-gun; he is in favour of background checks and controls on assault weapons, but you know this is someone that is the very fabric of this nation.  But yet at the same time, he values civil rights; he worked for immigration for a brief period of time but he's flown the entire border.  He's also been down in Central America so he understands what the root causes are.  That's why these people are coming across the border now.  He sees that there's no simple fix and he knows that it's not the policy of the current administration that's causing that.  He knows that these are factors that would have driven them north no matter who was president. And, there are situations that we've got to change.  So I think that there are enough people that these issues resonate with now, that they may have been oblivious to them before January and before the storm in February, but they're not as oblivious as they were before.  I think there's some Republicans that will stay home.  And this is also another different story.  Usually a Congressional race is only in November.  This is a local race.  We have no way of knowing what's going to happen, because most of the people that vote in the primary and in the general election never show up and vote in a local election.  So, it's going to be real interesting to see what happens with this one.  I've worked a lot of elections, but this one is the strangest I've ever come across. But basically, if you look at the demographics, the district has been steadily turning blue. ((WN))  All right.  Moving on to the reason of course that this election was called at all, the death of Mr Ron Wright, what does he feel about his governance \u2014 the governance of the late Ron Wright? ((Faith Chatham))  Ron Wright was the mayor pro tem in Arlington for a number of years, and at the same time he was the chief of staff of Joe Barton.  So, Ron Wright is basically just a shadow of Joe Barton.  He was only in office one year.  He did not have the opportunity to really make his own mark on that area because, for one thing he was battling cancer, and he was denying COVID-[19] and ended up, you know, sadly dying from COVID-19.  He was doing quite well, from what I understand in battling his cancer, and then he contracted COVID and was dead almost immediately.  But he was very extremist in many areas.  Mr Eddings is a very devout Christian, but he doesn't go around thumping the Bible, he doesn't go around using his religion as a tool.  Ron Wright did. Ron Wright as the, now, I don't know if Mr Eddings would say this, but I would say this, but as the tax collector of Tarrant County he had In God We Trust put on all the envelopes so when you got your tax notice from Tarrant County you got it and it said 'In God We Trust'.   He had that clearly on the side of the vehicles, and I'm a Christian too but I don't think that was the appropriate thing to do in those places.  And it was done in a very area, but also when he was the mayor pro tem of Arlington, he helped to push through a very extreme gas drilling programme.  The way they did that is that they came in, and they first of all leased the city's property, the county's property and the school district's property, and they had the flat prod[uction well]s and the wells already in all of these neighbourhoods.  And then they came to the people and they said \"oh, if you don't sign the gas contract, we'll take the gas anyway.\"  But, you know, you've already got this industrial waste dump in your neighbourhood. And so Arlington had, by the time he was no longer mayor pro tem, there were over 300 gas wells in the 99 square miles of Arlington.  I used to live there, and I had to leave because I couldn't breathe, the air quality was so bad.  I had watched our former Congressman, a wonderful man: Tommy Vandergriff, who was also a Democrat, then Republican, but I have watched him work for years for where we had a good zoning, where you knew when you built a house what was going to be next to you.  And in that one administration, you know, when Ron Wright was there, they managed to \u2014 and of course he was basically also working for Joe Barton \u2014 to push this through for the energy companies.  And they basically just completely ruined the entire zoning of Arlington.  And, you know, it's made a real problem for homeowners in that area. So, there's a lot of problems with Ron Wright in what he did, and he basically did not do anything for the people.  There wasn't anything that he fought, he voted time and time again against healthcare, and this district has a higher infant mortality rate than most third-world countries.  It has a higher maternal mortality rate than most third-world countries: you're more likely to die within a year of giving birth if you're a woman living in Tarrant County than you are if you live in most African countries.  So, he basically is voting against healthcare and voting against birth control, saying that he's pro-life while he's putting in place policies that are causing women and babies to die, and not doing anything about it. He didn't do anything about bringing good jobs to the area, he was so determined to use Joe Barton's vote to protect the big oil companies that he didn't do anything about \u2014 he kept their subsidies in place, and did nothing to subsidise the new industries that could create jobs for people.  And so, these are some of the problems, what he failed to do.  And then, the way he managed to, you know, who his friends were.  And there is a place for \u2014 Daryl Eddings is not anti-fossil fuel, he's not anti-energy, he just says, you know, we've got energy companies that have been here for a long time, we don't need to subsidise them.  They're already here. What we need to do is we need to go in and help the new industries get started so people can have new jobs that are here, and we need to revise our tax code and restore, you know, the top per cent shouldn't have the amount of tax breaks they have.  We have to get a working middle class again.  He would prefer to see us go back to the policies that were similar to what [Dwight D.] Eisenhower had, you know.  Eisenhower put in the Interstate Highway System and it opened commerce for the nation.  We've got to put in a really robust Internet system so that people can work at home.  In Ellis and Navarro County, there were lots of people that their kids couldn't study at home because they didn't have the Internet connectivity.  People have trouble working from home because the Internet is so slow.  We've got to get it to where every home in America has reliable connectivity so that we can move into the new way of working and the new way of studying. ((WN))  What are some of the most pressing issues Mr Eddings would raise to Congress if elected? ((Faith Chatham))  Healthcare.  Housing \u2014 affordable housing.  Healthcare, housing and education.  The cost of healthcare, housing and education has escalated much more rapidly than peoples' paycheques.  We also have to address the national debt; the way we do that is to get people at work, at good-paying jobs.  People say \"oh, $15 minimum\", well he's not just interested in a $15 minimum, he's interested in people who are not working to be able to get a good-paying job.  And then, the ones that are working, to have an opportunity to get the college and the training that they need, so they can qualify for higher-paying jobs. So, if we get people back to work, and then we get people that are underemployed employed better, and have a career ladder.  Most people don't have a career ladder anymore.  I'm an old woman and there was a career ladder when I was starting out, but you know, when you create a world like has been created by Phil Gramm and Ronald Reagan and those that have followed them, where independent contractors are about the best you can get, that you can get your college degree and you can be one of the best data people in the world but you're competing with people on the other side of the world, and the employers here are hiring them in India, in China, instead of hiring them here in your own community.  We've got to change that.  What we have done with our computer jobs, we're going to have new industry technologies that we haven't even thought of, and they're going to be the jobs that are going to employ the next generation.  We have to make sure that those patents and those jobs are here in America. If we do the R&D [research and development], we need to get them and have them here in America.  And the only way you do that is by revising the tax code so that it's not an incentive to invest abroad, but there is an incentive to invest here, and to invest in research and development and upgrading technology and employees, you know, in the training and the education of your employees.  These are things that need to be restored to the tax code, and it can be done out of that percentage of tax that has been gained, has been given in these Republican tax cuts recently that have given us such a hard time.  And when we do that, that's going to go ahead and help us rebuild the middle class, and it will help us get over the debt that we're going to have to go into to take care of COVID-19. ((WN))  Your website states \"Tea Party Republicans have neglected residents\" and \"Ronald Reagan's trickle-down economics leaves too many people out in the cold\".  Could you please elaborate? ((Faith Chatham))  Quite truthfully.  And a lot of what I was just saying.  Trickle-down economics was originally when Phil Gramm and Ronald Reagan basically said \"we're going to start giving tax cuts to industry because if we give a tax cut to industry, then the businesses, their profits will trickle down.\"  But it didn't work that way.  They gave the no-strings-attached tax breaks, and instead industry either \u2014 the people that got the tax breaks \u2014 either just banked it, and usually offshore, or they invested out shore, instead of investing here.  So, that's where we are.  And in doing that, we lost those jobs.  There were lots of people in Ellis and Navarro counties that had union jobs, they had security, they had retirement, they had training, they had healthcare and they knew that they had a job for as long as they did a decent job.  And all those jobs have just gone away. But the others didn't come in, you know, they really did not come forward.  Now, Daryl Eddings is a small business owner, and so, you know, he's not anti-business.  But he comprehends that we have got to be able to get our American workforce with some level of protection, and the way we have to do that is we have to outfit investment: we have to invest in our own workforce, and people aren't going to do that unless, you know, it's a shame that it's altruistically and wisely, they're not doing it.  But what we've found is we've found a lot more of these businesses have just been sold, you know, off by, you know, somebody buy it and then sell it to make a profit, buy it and sell it to make a profit, buy it and sell it to make a profit, take all the profit out of the good ones. There's nothing left for the people.  A good example is media; a very good example.  I started out in newspaper when I was a young woman, and we never made a lot of money in newspaper, we thought we had a hard time but as I have watched colleagues of mine that work for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram and the Dallas Morning News and these others: every time their newspaper gets sold, they get less and less and less.  And also, it's now gotten somewhere they have cut.  There are very few newspapers in the United States that really even have an investigative journalism team.  And of course, everybody else always, which, the newspapers find out what the background was before they got on the television and they got on the radio, and so it's hurting on almost every level, but that's just one example. We've got to get to the point where we have a tax code that encourages people to invest in our companies here, and invest in our workforce here.  And where workers and where companies look up and say \"you know, our workers are valuable.\"  And it used to be that way.  Workers used to be: you wanted to retain your workers, you didn't want to just have them be a contractor and walk away.  And so we've gone over the cheap and it's cost us dearly.  And it was very obvious with COVID.  We didn't have the supply chain in place to be able to have the equipment we needed to take care of our people. So, it's a national security issue, it's a jobs issue, it's an economy issue, it's a moral issue and it's not right for the middle class to be the one that's bearing the brunt of the taxes, and those who are the most wealthy not paying their fair share.  So, you know, and of course, Donald Trump always talked about \"I paid all these taxes\".  Well, he's talking about employee taxes.  He didn't pay any income taxes, he paid employee taxes: that was the money he collected from the employees out there with only!  [Laughs] It wasn't his paid taxes, you know!  And so they look at it and say \"well, I want the cheque\". And I've been a business owner too.  I know how hard it is to write those cheques when it's time to pay your employee interest.  But your employee taxes, it's not employment taxes, you know; what you collect from your employees you're passing on.  We've got to get to the point where it's not the employees that are bearing the brunt of it.  We need to share it around better, we need to be fair, it needs to be more equitable.  And so this is something that's going to have to be debated, and it's not going to be popular, but it has got to be done.  People have got to stop running away from that, and face it: that we do not have a workable tax code. And there's things that we get in place, and they're myths that have existed in this country about Ronald Reagan that the facts don't back up.  And we need to go back honestly and look at the facts, and see what happened and where it started \u2014 and it really started with Ronald Reagan and Phil Gramm right here in US Texas 6, and I would like to see it end in US Texas 6.  And let's have a new beginning.  People will come in and really look at, and it will be better for Democrats, it will be better for Republicans, it will be better. And he's not running just to represent Democrats \u2014 he's running to represent people.  He will be there for whoever.  He will be there for whoever.  He's not going to be there patting people on the back if they say that it was an illegal election because it wasn't an illegal election.  Once you have exhausted all of the legal appeals, recounts and you've gone through the courts, then you accept the outcome.  You don't go in and try to bludgeon the security officers at the Capitol, because your guy didn't win!  I've been very unhappy many, many, many times when the election results came in, but I never went out and was violent, I never went out and committed treason, you know, I never tried to do a palace coup.  That's what we saw happen in January, and it's really time to bring that back, yeah. We need people in office that will not be leading tours of the Capitol for people who are planning on coming in and kidnapping the Speaker of the House and the Vice President of the United States, to keep from the certification of votes.  This is the reality, you know.  We have Texas, we have congressmen from Texas that literally led tours the day before that insurrection, and it was a time when the Capitol was supposed to be closed; there were not supposed to be any tours!  The only ones that were on tours were these people that were, you know, yelling with Trump.  And so, we've got to get back and change that around. The other thing that's really important is we've got to stop dark money in our elections, we've got to \u2014 and this is a very bipartisan area, the Koch brothers don't like it, but they have done surveys of most of the Republicans, and most of the Republican base said \"we need to know who the millionaires are that are financing our elections; we need the transparency.\"  That's a very bipartisan issue.  He's very much for revoking Citizens United and getting dark money out of Congress, out of our elections, and we need to have an independent body, an independent body, not elected officials draw the barriers, the boundaries.  Elected officials picking their voters is not how this was supposed to work, you know.  That's not how we're supposed to be doing it, and so there's some things that need to be done on election reform, and they're reasonable things. And I think in the long run, a lot of Republicans will buy into it.  The people in the glass room, some of them in the office won't because it, you know, it protects them in office.  But we need to get it to where we're really protecting the people, not protecting the ones who are in front of us. ((WN))  Your website also [says]: \"I served within the chain of command under the commander-in-chief, but I did not swear an oath to any one man or political party.\"  Could you please elaborate on that? ((Faith Chatham))  Okay, there are a lot of people, as of January 6, that are putting Donald Trump \u2014 and I mean, this is appalling to see what some of the churches have been doing \u2014 they've been putting the golden Trump up there like he is some demigod; and there are members of Congress that, instead of recognising how serious it was, they have been very frightened of going against Trump.  Several of the Republicans have stated that if it had been a secret vote, that they would have voted to remove him.  The repercussions, you know, the repercussions on it.  Donald Trump is not to who we swear.  You don't swear a code of allegiance to the president of the United States.  The commander-in-chief is charged with leading our military, but our military swears an oath to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.  And that's also the oath that the president takes, and that's what Congress takes. But instead of looking at what we do to protect the Constitution of the United States, which was to have a peaceful turnover of the government, there were too many of them that continued to say \"this is an illegal election\", \"it was not fair\", you know, and even though the judges by and large were Republican appointees by Donald Trump, they were saying \"oh this isn't fair, some Democrats have done it\", they put out too many lies and they instigated a level of doubt and discord and disharmony that destabilises our country \u2014 and actually led to a large number of people, many of whom were law enforcement agents, and many of whom were veterans that stormed the Capitol with a military plan.  It was very clearly executed, this was not spontaneous, it was a plan to go in and forcibly stop the certification of the vote to turnover the presidency to the man who had won the election.  And this is not how it's supposed to work. Daryl Eddings came back from Iraq in a coma.  He spent eighteen months in a military hospital undergoing multiple surgeries and years of rehab to get to the point where he could work and make a living for his family.  He lost people over there that he cares about who were fighting for this country, and for him to sit there and watch what happened on January 6, and to hear the words that came out of the mouth of Ted Cruz and Donald Trump and Louie Gohmert and a lot of other elected officials that basically were lies.  He knows what it is to be in countries where there are palace coups.  And to sit here and see this going on in his own country?  Can you imagine what kind of a reaction he has?  Can you imagine how it hits him in the gut?  How he would decide to put his life on the line? This is a man that has always been very private.  There were very few photographs of him because he was a US marshal, and he worked on drug interdiction, and he knew that there were people that might recognise him from those missions that were not nice people.  And he didn't want them knocking on his door with his family.  And he sat down and talked to his family about it and decided to put his face out there, and put his name out there and run for Congress because his that worried about where our nation is right now.  He's that worried for his neighbours: Democrats and Republicans, independents and Libertarians. ((WN))  How would Mr Eddings handle the vaccine rollout if elected? ((Faith Chatham))  He's very pleased with how President Biden has done it.  The vaccine rollout has been \u2014 Donald Trump was good about getting it accelerated on making it, but he did not have in place a real plan to distribute it.  Daryl Eddings, he spent, you know years in emergency management, you know.  He's been working on another Master's [degree] in emergency management, but he would be working very much like what President Biden has been doing.  He'd be working with the scientists, he would be working with the supply chain, he'd be working with the military, he'd be working with the nurses to get it out to as many people as possible as fast as possible, and as efficiently as possible.  And that's one thing he's very efficient is when there's something that needs to be done, he knows how to move the people and move the resources and assess the problem and get the job done. And so on that area, he's been much more relieved to see what has happened this year than what we were watching last year. ((WN))  How would Mr Eddings help the economically disadvantaged if elected? ((Faith Chatham))  Jobs.  Very definitely jobs.  Jobs and access to education, and also expansion of healthcare.  Right here in Texas, the Texas Legislature and the Governor refused to expand Medicaid but we're basically paying for other states to have Medicaid!  There's so many things: everybody that has held a private health insurance policy is paying a higher premium because we have so many uninsured people in Texas.  He would be working to, you know, to expand it, to look at the ACA [Affordable Care Act], see what the problems are instead of revoking it like Joe Barton has tried to do; he would basically be working to look at it, to see what the problems are and to find a solution to make it work for as many people as possible \u2014 not to eliminate the options for private healthcare, not at all \u2014 but yet to give more people an opportunity to. Also, he would be looking for ways that people could have an opportunity to buy a home again.  Housing cost is a big problem.  We have too many families that are being pushed out of their housing, and we have too many veterans living under the bridges, and he has worked on veterans' housing with a number of non-profit organisations for years; that's been one of the things that he's worked very heavily on is veterans' housing.  And, he also has been very active on veterans' mental health issues, and so a lot of families are suffering because of mental health issues and they don't have the opportunity to have the drug treatment on demand that they need there.  If there's a long waiting list for it, when you get ready for it there's a waiting list, and you know with an addict, somebody that has a substance abuse problem, if you don't strike when the striking is hot, if they have to wait then they're not ready to go in and do anything about it. And so that's one of the big problems he'd be working with, very much.  He's done a lot on suicide prevention and mental health issues and PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder].  And these are issues that are not Democratic or Republican, they're not black, they're not white: these are problems that, because every time we have a lot of veterans that come home, and then there are a lot of us that are suffering from PTSD that were in military, you know, they are military things; people that have been in school shootings or in different areas of that area have PTSD.  And so, we need a better network, a better social network. And then, we also have to strengthen our retiree social network.  Retired people shouldn't be paying some guaranteed student loans out of their Social Security cheque, and when somebody has been working for a company they should be able to take their retirement plan with them.  And what we've allowed is in there are too many cases of corporations declaring bankruptcy to get out of paying the retirement for their employees, and then they leave it to the federal government to take up the slack.  We may need to go with something like what we have for workers' comp where there's an insurance: it's an insurance policy instead of a pension plan, and that it goes with the employee wherever they're going, so that after you've worked twenty years if you've worked at five or six or seven different jobs, you still have some security. And we have to keep Social Security, you know.  Social Security is a \u2014 we can't do it, but the way we do that is by putting in work, you know.  People have to work: them ore we work, the more we pay in, the stronger these systems are.  But as long as our jobs are offshore, as long as employers can just, you know, call you in as an independent contractor and let you go, you know, whenever it suits them and not, you know, not in that area, as long as we have no protection for our employees and there's no investment by the companies into our workforce, we're not going to have the resources we need for people to have the retirement as necessary. Houses, jobs, retirement, access to infrastructure, health rights: those are the things that everybody needs.  Those are not Democrat needs, and Republican doesn't.  Those are the things everybody needs, and that is exactly what he is, that's exactly what he'll be working for.  And also, everybody's vote must count, and we need to know that it's counted fairly, and that when that election is over that you can go through the process and you may find out that some of it was wrong and you can correct it, but if you find out that it wasn't wrong, then you just, you know, you just take it on your chin and you just wait for the next election.  That's the American Way, and that's where we need to go back to. ((WN))  What are his opinions on President Biden? ((Faith Chatham))  He is relieved to see the things that President Biden has been doing.  He feels like reversing most of President Trump's executive orders was a good move.  He is pleased to see the calibre of people with experience to accept the mission of the departments they're being appointed to, that'll be his appointees, you know.  Because we found under Trump people that had no credentials whatsoever were appointed, that was mainly cronyism, and they were appointed to destroy the departments, not to build them up.  Daryl Eddings believes in good government, not no government.  That doesn't mean that government gets to do everything, you know, but basically we always try to do better. We had a bureaucracy that basically, our civil service was designed so that it didn't, you know, the civil service and the Hatch Act worked for us; my mother was still in civil service.  I didn't even know she was a Democrat until she was dying, I thought she had voted Republican until she was on her deathbed because she took the Hatch Act so seriously.  [Laughs] She didn't even let her kids know what her partisanship was.  But because a federal employee is supposed to be non-partisan in the way they conduct their business, we had a steady transition, and we also had experts who knew what was going on, was there to continue running things until the next one is in place.  That's been really tattered and shattered, you know, in so many areas. One good example is the post office department, you know, the post office department.  There's no for-profit business that's ever going to make profit serving every community in the nation, you know.  No company is going to make a profit serving every community in the nation.  And yet at the same time, they're going out of their way to destroy the United States Postal Office that basically services every community in the nation.  And so, we have to go back in and look at that, so it's good. He's for people that are science, data, look at the facts, go with the facts, use your science, use your data, rely on the experts, get the politics out of it and make the decision based off what will work.  That's Daryl Eddings.  Make the decision based on truth, the best information available, verify it and put people in charge that have a background and the expertise to do the job, and who believe that the mission, as is set out in our legislation of that agency, is what they really have a commitment to.  If they don't have a commitment to the mission of that agency, they should not be put in charge of that agency.  And so he sees Biden trying to do that, you know, more so.  And in the last administration, they wouldn't. ((WN))  Well, we've talked about Mr Biden, so what are Mr Eddings' thoughts on former President Trump? ((Faith Chatham))  Oh...he never called him the commander-in-chief, as he was out of the military by the time, he was retired by the time he came in, but he never called him the commander-in-chief, he called him '45' because he never earned his respect.  There was not any reason for Donald Trump to be leading our troops.  Donald Trump was putting too many people at risk on a whim without reading the intelligence briefings, without listening to his generals, without, you know, unless it was an echo chamber that was feeding his ego, he had no time for it.  And it was dangerous, it was dangerous.  He's relieved that he's no longer, you know, I mean it's not that he was a Republican, it was that he was a danger, and that he was a danger to this nation, he was a danger to the men and women who are putting their lives on the line to watch out for us. And also, he violated some of our greatest allies, you know.  The things that he did to our allies was unconscionable, and it wasn't just the ones that were our peacetime allies; he basically betrayed some of our allies when they were, with their lives were in danger and they were literally fighting for their very lives.  And so the betrayals, you know, it's very difficult for a man who has had the kind of life that Daryl Eddings has to watch what happened under Donald Trump, and not be appalled. ((WN))  What are his thoughts on the ongoing crisis at the Southern border? ((Faith Chatham))  Well, he worked for immigration.  And, at the same time he understands, and then he also worked on drug interdiction, so he's flown from the top to the bottom, but he's also been in those countries.  And he knows that it's not what our policy is that is bringing them here.  What's bringing them here is what's happening in their countries.  It's the terror, the crime, the severe poverty and it was bad enough because they're always having hurricanes and disasters, they're just knocking them off the line, but when you get down to it you also have COVID-19 that's on top of it.  But he knows that if someone is terrified, and they believe that they or their children are going to die if they stay in their neighbourhood, they're going to go somewhere else.  And, they're not going to be able to keep them back; they're going to go wherever it is they think that they will be safer \u2014 maybe not safe, but safer. So he knows that those are situations that \u2014 it's a humanitarian problem, but it's going to have to be solved on a multi-pronged attack.  It has to be solved in co-operation with the countries to help the countries counter the drug and the terror and the gang activity.  They also have to be helped in a way that deals with the poverty.  And then, we have to be as humane as we can in receiving those who came.  We had four years of the United States government refusing to process asylum applications in a timely manner.  We were already understaffed before this happened, and then he made that to try to make it as a punishment.  You can't make it as a punishment. He also knows that there is no way to put a wall up, because he's flown from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico; just the terrain would make it totally impossible.  And besides that, what are you going to do with a fence when you have two oceans on both sides of you, you know.  So you're not going to keep people over.  The higher the fence, they're going to come over.  So, we have to find a way.  But as a law enforcement officer, he really believes we have to be able to allow the people who are here to come out of the shadows, because as long as we have people in the shadows, and they're afraid to co-operate with law enforcement, it's harder to take care of the drug dealers in the cartels, and it's harder to take care of criminals that are preying on them. And as long as a criminal can prey on somebody, and there's somebody there that was a witness or a victim, and they can't co-operate with law enforcement, we're all less safe.  So, we have to do something to give them a chance to have legal residency so they're not afraid of being deported, so that they can co-ordinate with law enforcement here, and he sees that as a real nice thing.  And he did go down to Brownsville with ACLU [American Civil Liberties Union] when they were under the Trump Administration; he actually went into the courtroom and saw children that were being brought before the court, without an adult.  He saw multiple immigrants, multiple people that were in orange shirts, orange sheets that were teetered together, they will all fly together as a mass thing to be deported, not even having an individual chance before a judge.  He saw things that were not fine, as a criminal justice person, that was not fair, and that were not humane. And what's happening now is very sad, but they're at least trying to take care of these children, they're trying to move them out of those shelters as fast as possible, they're trying to get them, they're trying to speed up the background checks \u2014 that's one of the big problems: they have to do background checks on these people that are coming forward to be their guardians, because they're children that have literally ended up being sex trafficking by people who claimed them, so you have to do that.  It's not an instant process, but yet at the same time what you do with those children, and the mental health support that they have while they're in there, you don't go in there and tell them that their parents have deserted them.  You don't lie to the parents and tell them, you know, those things, so we have to be honest, we have to be truthful with the people, we have to do the best job we can do, and our best job isn't good enough, but in the last administration it was cruel!  You know, it wasn't that it wasn't good enough, it was that it violated the Geneva Conventions in almost every way. And also, we test them.  You know, they were refusing even to give those kids flu shots under Trump.  We test them, and, you know, we do our best to take care of them, and we try to get them out of our custody as fast as possible, because the more you have together, the higher likelihood of sexual assault, or violence, or harm to one of them.  And so, you have to process them, and get them out as fast as possible, and protect them because, you know, it's just a nightmare.  But yeah, he was very concerned for the children; he's got seven grandchildren of his own, and what he saw as a former INS [Immigration and Naturalization Service] person knows that was not how it was supposed to operate.  And it still has a ways to go now, but at least they're trying to do it, instead of trying to do the opposite. ((WN))  What are his thoughts on the size of the American military? ((Faith Chatham))  That's one question that we haven't discussed: about the size of the military.  I can't really give you an answer.  I do know that he believes very much in the military, he believes in the military; it is a peacekeeping operation, he believes that it is beneficial in that it is one of the ways that people who come from poorer families can get an education, can have a chance to buy a house with a reasonable area, you know.  If you live through your military service, you have benefits, but also there's a lot of people that do not survive their military service. He doesn't believe that the military should be used for everything, you know.  We have reasons to use the military; we don't use the military just at the whim of the commander-in-chief.  There has to be a valid reason to use the military, and so that's one of the reasons that he trusted Hillary Clinton more than he trusted Donald Trump, you know, on that area. ((WN))  What are his thoughts on the criminal justice system? ((Faith Chatham))  Well, he was an officer, of course.  He believes in it, and he also believes that we have many wonderful law enforcement people, and we have some bad apples.  We have too many racists that are in the, you know.  White nationalists do not belong in law enforcement.  There are some people that do not have the temperament to be in law enforcement.  And he became a friend of Sandra Bland's mother during the time that she was trying to find out what happened to her daughter, what the real circumstances were of her death in custody, and he has looked very closely with her, over the years, that she actually came to Texas in 2018, I guess it was; maybe this was '16, 2018, and volunteered in Dr Shirley McKellar's campaign because of the relationship they established. He was very pleased to see the Sandra Bland Act signed into law by Governor [Greg] Abbott.  It does some things that are important; he would like to see the George Floyd Act and the Sandra Bland Act, those elements of it be merged and passed nationally.  The Sandra Bland Act has transparency, it has a lot of protection, it has a lot of things in dealing with the mentally ill and drug addiction; very often a jailer would just say they had gone by and checked on them when they didn't, so it calls for electronic monitoring so they have to push the button right there at the cell to show that they have checked on that person.  It basically says that if there's ever a death in custody that you don't get to investigate it yourself, it has to be an independent law enforcement agency to do the investigation. So those are the protections.  Then, the George Floyd Act has some others that are important too; now the George Floyd Act basically goes in and says if there is a registry, then we need to have a registry of law enforcement officers that have been discharged because of not following the protocol.  And so that's pretty controversial with it, but he also believes that we have to go in and address; he believes that everyone should be able; he believes in protecting the Second Amendment rights, obviously, he is a gun owner. But, he believes that there are AK-47s, he believes there are military weapons, and weapons that can be modified to be military weapons, that belong on the battlefield, and that rifles and long guns should be used for hunting game, not hunting people.  They shouldn't be worn around as a fashion statement into restaurants to intimidate other diners.  We need to be able to have everyone licensed, everyone background-checked, everyone to have training.  And we have to close the loopholes of gun purchases.  There's still going to have the people that are getting a hold of the weapons illegally, but if you take care of that, you can then address the others.  But, law enforcement are designed to shoot to kill if there is a threat: that's their protective life. He believes that we have got to stop using our police for everything that we haven't got covered.  They're not supposed to be the box we check when we don't have anything else to do it.  Every 9-1-1 call should not be going to the police.  If it's mental health, drug addiction, we should have people who are trained in mental health and trained in drug addiction do the first call on that.  You might have a police officer with you, but you shouldn't, you know, those tiny areas. He knows that he's where he's at because people helped him when he came back, you know.  And he sees a lot of veterans that are falling through the cracks, and he's very concerned about that.  And then, there are other people that are falling through the cracks.  And so, law enforcement, you know, law enforcement needs.  And also, he's a black man.  He's got black grandchildren.  He's a law enforcement person; you know, the bias that goes, the more likely you're going to be shot by a police officer if you're mentally ill, or you're a person of colour.  Those are things that would concern any father, any grandfather. And yet at the same time, the officers shouldn't have, you know, if an officer is at greater risk of being killed now because of the number of guns that are out there.  How do you know, if you're in a grocery store, and someone comes in with a gun, if they're coming in just because they've got a licence and they're just shopping, or if they're coming in to do something.  We used to be able to know that if somebody came into Piggly Wiggly with a gun, they didn't have a good purpose, you know.  They can stop them close to do the door.  Now, they're right up on the aisle with you, before you get a chance; they're right up on top of you, able to do a lot of damage.  So, there's a lot more risk to law enforcement right now than there was before, we have to address it on both ways. ((WN))  What does he feel on Medicare? ((Faith Chatham))  Medicare?  The best, most efficiently-managed healthcare delivery in the nation.  It's not perfect, but it is definitely, when you look at the cost of administration for Medicare, it is the lowest of any insurance company, any insurance divider; even military is not as efficiently run as Medicare.  But, he would like to look at possibly a buy-in for people that are 50, to where some people might be able to buy into it; he's not sure, but he thinks that something should be evaluated.  He wants to put on the table of our system, and look at what the flaws are, see where we started with the Affordable Care Act, what we know now are the problems, the inequities, see how we can correct those, and how we can get more people covered, and it is by making Medicare go a little bit longer, or if it's a way of jacking up the Affordable Care Act. But also, he believes that people should have dental coverage, you know.  That's a way to find a way to make dental coverage affordable.  So, you know, there's a lot of heart disease that's caused because of bad dentistry, and there's a lot of people that can't afford to go to the dentist, and it concerns him that people are working and they can't afford to, you know, they're too poor to go to the dentist when they need to, they're too poor to go to the doctor, they're too poor to get that psychiatric counselling that they need.  And so, the way that we do this is we invest in our people, and that's one of the investments in the people. We also have to see how do we pay for it.  And that's the other chance it is not an easy solution.  We have to look at what we can do, and what's reasonable and how do we pay for it.  And those are questions that, instead of fighting over it we need to come to the table and solve, you know.  Really look at them, and debate them, and research them and solve them instead of just asking the book when we're with them.  He's a person that basically looks at it, listens and figures out a way to get it done.  And he's done that since he's left \u2014 he's done that when he was in the military, and he's done it since he left the military.  Operation Battle Buddy is an example, because when he was with Brooke Medical \u2014 now, there's two organisations: this isn't the K9 unit, this is the one that does the mentoring, but he founded that organisation.  When he was the CEO of it, they were mentoring 20 thousand vets that had, you know, come through Brooke Military Hospital. But he looks at it, he sees a need and he finds a way to get it done: that's what they need down in East Texas with the mental health services, and that's what he's done with some veterans' housing projects in different areas.  So, and that's just as an individual.  And so, as a congressperson I believe that he has the relationship with a number of people in Congress, and they'll look at him and they'll see his heart, and see his skill and see his willingness to solve problems.  You know, you gravitate together: those who are really wanting to find solutions find ways to find solutions, and that's where he'll be; he'll be with the ones that are looking to find the solution. ((WN))  What are his thoughts on President Biden's recent talks with China [on March 19, 2021]? ((Faith Chatham))  I don't know, we haven't talked about that.  So that's one, on all these mountains and mountains of things we have not talked about China, other than what's happened with trade.  So, I can't even answer that one. ((WN))  What are his thoughts, then, on the rise in anti-Asian sentiment as a result of the pandemic and recent shooting in Atlanta? ((Faith Chatham))  Oh, it's deplorable.  Hate and discrimination coming against any person is an abomination to him.  He considers one of his proudest moments was when he was on the Pettus Bridge with the late honourable John Lewis.  He does not believe in, you know, I mean if you're Muslim, if you're Asian, if you're LGBT, if you're a woman, if you're black, if you're Hispanic, you're an American, and you should be treated with respect as a human being.  And no one, in this country of any race is responsible for COVID-19.  Nobody here caused it, nobody here brought it over here, you know, there's some people that are responsible for not helping us deal with it in a timely manner, you know, there's some people that dropped the ball on it, but we did not cause it.  And just because of your ethnicity, you know, you definitely should not in that area, so the discrimination in the attacks on them are very troubling. ((WN))  The power outages of February left millions without power, sometimes for days, including of course, the sixth district.  Its damages are currently estimated at US$195 billion and 111 estimated to have been killed.  How will Mr Eddings prevent this from happening again, should he be elected? ((Faith Chatham))  On the federal level: require all energy transmission sites to be listed and winterised.  Without protecting them out on the cheap, you know.  I mean, instead of just keeping them from having to do that, here in Texas, we know that there's a piece of paper.  They can just have them listed of which ones were supposed to get that, and also they did not have the winterisation.  Our pipelines should have been buried deeper, but the pipelines doesn't require it.  So, on a federal level we're probably going to have to go in and put some controls in on a federal level to address these issues, these issues. And also, there has to be some kind of control put in on the profiteering schemes of energy.  Here in Texas, Joe Barton, Greg Abbott and certain legislators have done their very best to protect their big donors at the expense of everybody else, and it's cost people lives.  And you know, now Abbott's trying to deflect from it, you know, he's sent people down to the border, he's tried all kinds of things.  He's done his math bit, all this stuff to deflect from the fact that he really blew it...but he really blew it, and he basically \u2014 they sat there and they knew, they knew from 2011 what was going to happen.  They were told in 2011 what they needed to do, and every year in January my electric bill always jumped up even though I didn't use any more electricity. And every Texan has paid through the nose because they have willingly taken compression stations offline so they could get those higher prices in January, and this time it crashed.  And they still got them, you know.  Two and three and sometimes even a thousand per cent higher: that's profiteering, that's schemes, and that has to do with the failure of politicians to look out for the people of Texas.  And the buck rests not just with the PUC [Public Utility Commission of Texas] and not just when what was left, the buck rests with the Governor, and with certain people who have been in office that have been the real protectors of that sector at all costs.  That sector is an important sector, but they should not be allowed to profiteer at the expense of the Texas citizens. ((WN))  What sets Mr Eddings apart from other candidates in the Democratic Party; of course, there are multiple running, there are multiple Democrats, multiple Republicans, multiple everyone.  So, what sets him apart? ((Faith Chatham))  There are some others that are veterans that are running on the Democrat and Republican sides, but none of them have the width of experience he has.  None of them have the experience in emergency management.  It was really a[n] eye-opener for me during Hurricane Katrina when I realised that I couldn't just call the people that were running the show in Arlington while we were receiving them, because they were locked in a, you know, in a secure area and the public had no access to the telephone in that area.  A state of emergency, which is martial law is a very serious thing, and most citizens don't understand what happens during that. He does, because he has worked states of emergency for years in California, and then the senior operations officer over there, so if something happens in the district and he's in Congress he's going to know what's happening, he's going to be able to put his hands on them, he's going to be able to know who to contact, how to contact them, what to look for, what usually happens where the break-down is, to take care of things: that's the level that he has.  Also, he comes with them.  This is a personal situation: I travelled with him a lot, and he was the security person on our team.  And usually, we never, you know usually, if there was something we wanted it was no problem, but if it was something that had to do with security we always knew that if he nodded or said no that it was no, because he is always looking out for the security of everyone around him. If you're in his neighbourhood, he's going to be as concerned about your security as he is going to be about his own wife's security.  That's where he looks at.  He looks at what is going to keep people alive, and at the same time respect their freedom to be the very best that they can be.  That's how he is.   He is the most \u2014 I'll tell you, he's a hard candidate to work for, because he's so modest!  You know, I mean he's unlike any politician I've ever worked with because he's not a politician, he is a person that is \u2014 he's usually finding solutions and pulling other people together to make them happen, and then he pushes them to the foreground but doesn't take any credit for what he instigated, for what he did. He's not out there to take vows for himself, he's out there to make things better.  He sincerely is out there to make things better.  You know, of course that's coming from somebody who knows him, and I wouldn't be doing this \u2014 I would not be doing this if I didn't know him as well as I do, because basically I said \"I'm not doing this again!\"  I've done enough of that, you know, it's time for somebody else to look to own this ship, but yeah, he's just, he's a very rare individual. And also, in the years I have known him I have never once had something the man told me that I couldn't take at face.  He has never even covered up, you know, I mean he might not say anything about it but there's never been one field, one attempt to misdirect anyone I have ever seen in all the years I've known him.  That's not something you come across in these politicians.  I don't know how you put that in the story, but that's just not; he's just not your normal egg, you know.  He's just not normal egg. ((WN))  How has COVID-19 affected the campaign? ((Faith Chatham))  Oh, enormously.  Because for one thing, block walking: usually, you're out meeting people and rubbing hands and all that, and that's practically every interview, every meeting is by Zoom, you know, we're just now getting ready to starting with block walking where we're having to, you know, all of that we're trying to, you know, we'll try to get people vaccinated so that they can be out there.  We've done the masks, social distancing and we have Dr McKellar, who is a RN [Registered nurse], who was a commander over military units in Iraq, in the Middle East, who has basically set down what our COVID-19 protocols are. It makes all the difference in the world on how we did it; it made a big difference in just being able to file.  Usually when you file, you go into different Democratic club meetings and you go to your neighbours, and you get your petition signatures.  Well, when he said he was going to try and do petition signatures in three days during a pandemic, I said \"it couldn't happen\", but he got his veteran buddies out there and they basically collected the, you know 5500 signatures that we needed.  We didn't use them, because we didn't have time to check them out to make sure they were valid, and we still paid the money but to be able to make contact with that many people is astronomical. So, we're still doing the things that we can do, and you know, in next week we're going to actually start literature drops instead of, normally you go and you knock on the door, you try to talk to people, we're going to be trying to do literature drops.  Somebody comes out and gets them to talk to them, but they'll be at distance and everybody'll have a mask and, you know, that whole kind of area.  So, it makes it very different. And also, people are hurting, you know. We're dealing with people who are in greater need, even if they have the roof over their head and the money isn't the situation, they've got emotional needs, they've got psychological needs, they've got grieving needs that have gone on.  And so, everyone is in a very different place this year than they were last year. And also, if it were not for COVID, two of the three seats that are coming up this month in Congress would not be having special elections.  One of them in Louisiana was because the congressman took a job in the Biden administration, but the other one is because the young man died of COVID-19, and so did Ron Wright.  So, COVID is making the difference politically and opening seats up, and that's not how you plan on running.  It also means that this is the most complex election \u2014 we had fifty days to do what normally you do in eighteen months in a congressional race.  And just to file the paperwork and get the checking account to do those kinds of things is astronomical. And also, a candidate usually has months in which to get his one minute, his two minute, his three minute elevator speech, and to get all, you know all that kind of stuff, and to get the issues, and you did it all at the same time in very accelerated speeds.  And you're running against \u2014 there's 23 people on the ballot, who knows what in the world that's going to do, and you can't judge, you can't go back and look at any other election and make a guess about what the turnout's going to be.  Because, even if it was another special election it wouldn't have been a special election between these candidates, you know.  And if it was a congressional race, it wouldn't have been a special election with your local candidate, so it's just a crapshoot, you know, who knows what's going to happen here. But we do know this: that whatever we do, we will be building some infrastructure, we'll be identifying some voters, we will be engaging some voters that may not have been engaged, we will be bringing out some folks that voted in 2020 to a local election for a congressional race, and maybe some of these folks will get in the habit of voting in their municipal elections, and we have a difference, you know.  And that may be a good one, because if they get in a habit when they're young, then maybe they'll continue doing that.  So, you know, whatever happens \u2014 there's a good side and a difficult side anyway you check it. ((WN))  If Mr Eddings isn't elected this time, what do you anticipate his ambitions for the future would be? ((Faith Chatham))  He's already said that he's running in 2022, you know, if he isn't elected.  In fact, we had a discussion today about his filing his FEC [Federal Election Commission] intention to run, you know, and I put it out to him, you know \"you've already got your checking account, you've already got your ads clean, you've already got a lot of stuff done, and so, you know just go with it.\"  Yeah, his intention is to run in the 20s, he's been thinking about running for a long time, he just hadn't thought about running this year because he didn't know this seat was going to be open. ((WN))  Light-hearted question to end this: which historical figure would he identify with most and why, or which historical figure do you think he identifies with most and why? ((Faith Chatham))  Okay, he says the two that he admires most, and that he would rather fashion himself after would be John Lewis and Ruth Bader Ginsburg.  And that is because they each faced great discrimination, they each persevered and they each opened doors to segments of people that many people thought would never be opened, and basically he said \"if it is necessary, it is not impossible.\"  You can't afford for it to be impossible if it's something people desperately, finally need, and so you continue working for that as long as it takes to take care of it, and those are two conclusive of that, so he looks at that. This man hasn't got a misogynistic bone in his body, I mean, it's just incredible, you know.  I've asked him what he thought about Don't ask, don't tell in the military, and he said \"some of the best soldiers I've ever known: men and women were under don't ask don't tell, and it was good for them to be able to come out of the covers on that type area.\"  He's not at all, he has no problems with LGBTQ in the military.  And he also truly has no problems with women because he was staunchly behind Hillary Clinton, and he has put the last eight years of his life on hold to try to get Shirly McKellar elected over Louis Gohmert down in East Texas. So, he just, you know, he's a rare bird. ((WN))  Any final comments? ((Faith Chatham))  Well, I think I'm pretty well commented! [Laughs]"}, "4-81": {"heading": "Wikinews interviews candidate for New York City mayor Vitaly Filipchenko ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikinews_interviews_candidate_for_New_York_City_mayor_Vitaly_Filipchenko", "date": "16-June-2021", "text": "In early May, Wikinews extended an invitation to Vitaly Filipchenko, an independent candidate in the 2021 New York City mayoral election, set to take place November 2nd, alongside other candidates. Filipchenko answered some questions about his policies and campaign during a phone interview. Filipchenko, registered on the New York City Campaign Finance Board as Vitaly A. Filipchenko, is the first Russian candidate for New York City mayor, being born in Tomsk, Siberia in 1973, according to news agency Sputnik.  He has since naturalised as a United States citizen.  According to the web site, Filipchenko has been educated in road construction and maintenance and owns a moving services company; he describes himself on his web site as a \"small business owner\".  On his web site's platform page, he says that \"[m]y English may not be perfect - but my platform is.\" Incumbent Democratic mayor Bill de Blasio, who won re-election in the 2017 New York City mayoral election by 66.5%, cannot run for a third term under term limits.  As of April 28, 22 candidates are currently running, the majority of whom are also Democrats.  Ahead of the June Democratic primary for New York City mayor, a poll conducted May 23 and 24 by WPIX and Emerson College of 12 Democratic candidates with a margin of error of 3.2 per cent has former commissioner for the New York City Department of Sanitation Kathryn Garcia and Borough President of Brooklyn Eric Adams leading with 21.1% and 20.1%, respectively. Please introduce yourself, your history and your background, first. ((Vitaly Filipchenko))  Okay.  My name is Vitaly Filipchenko, I am an independent candidate for New York City mayor. ((WN))  What was it like growing up under perestroika and the Soviet Union's dissolution? ((Vitaly Filipchenko))  So, really interesting.  Like, basically, if you give a child a little bit more interest and a chance to be, how do I put it, in capitalism; it's like you give a child the stock market.  Giving that kind of information: what this mean, what this is, what this for?  That time was like that. ((WN))  What made you decide to run for New York City mayor? ((Vitaly Filipchenko))  I have [not seen] an honest mayor before, trying to see how [immigrants get] marginalised, because all this big money.  Doesn't matter where you have it: from Democrats, from Republicans.  They just followed that money.  And all these big politician people?  Its only interest: money, not real problem[s] from the people.  They doesn't matter, Democrats, Republicans, they just making money.  It's a money machine, for politician['s] gains. ((WN))  According to Sputnik News, you're the first Russian candidate for New York City mayor.  Do you think that will help you among the immigrant population in the city? ((Vitaly Filipchenko))  Not really, because people [are] so afraid.  We didn't see the real democracy in New York.  Everyone can speak up for democracy, but half of them [are] not registering to vote, half of them, they [do] not believe anymore in politicians \u2014 doesn't matter who you are \u2014 and a lot of people, just like, they don't care, you know?  They can talk too much, but they['re] not doing anything. ((WN))  Why should New Yorkers vote for you? ((Vitaly Filipchenko))  Because I'm a basic, basically like [the] whole history of, like, American immigrants: I came from nothing, and became a self-[made] businessman, I became [a] hardworking person.  And anyone from any kind of country, anyone from any kind of community, they can see [me] reflecting themself, themselves, because they're working really hard.  I'm not standing behind any kind of big corporation, I'm not standing behind any kind of money.  I'm just a regular guy.  I want to be honest, I want to make a real democracy progress. Lots of people, they just get tons of money, and they don't care.  They not, really don't care.  They don't have experience [with] what we have a problem in New York.  I represent small business owners, I represent immigrants, I represent people who will struggle in this pandemic.  Other candidates?  They do not represent anyone.  They just represent themselves.  They are one per cent [of the] rich people.  They never have problems, because rich people make more money on this problem.  Other population[s], like office employee[s], who've been working in an office in a pandemic, who['re] still working from home, and making more than 100 thousand, and it's working at home!  They just [do] not see [the] problem, what's exactly, what's going on right now.  They just keep working! I represent essential business who are really working outside, who are really working with the streets, working with the people who are exactly doing the job for the people.  Like, most of them, these employees, this is a high-level money, they['re] just still working from home, and still making [the] same amount [of] money.  We, we [are] struggling, because we got big problem[s] with our business: a lot of business[es] get shut down, a lot of business[es] get closed like restaurants, deliveries.  And a small business owners, it's like really struggling, and in New York, [the] Mayor has done nothing for this.  It's also a horrible person. ((WN))  You've criticised to Sputnik News that \"if we look at other states, warm Florida, Georgia, their state budgets are not even ten times but 20, 50 times smaller than New York's. And their roads are better.\"  Could you elaborate on that? ((Vitaly Filipchenko))  Oh, it's simple.  I'm [a] civil engineer.  I got a[n] engineering degree for building roads: highway roads, and you can see how the difference [in the] state[s] of New York, Florida, Tennessee, Virginia, North Carolina.  In Florida, they got a budget [of] USD4 billion, and the roads are so much better.  In New York state, you got like [a] 190 billion budget in the state, and it got ten times worse, because I can see what they're doing right now.  They just manipulate the budget. They're doing one road, and [it's] suppose[d to be] if you do a good job, you can repair this road after ten years.  But if you do repairs after like one or two years, they just motion budget, they're just like, obviously they're stealing money.  If you're doing the same repair after two years, it's obviously \"oh you're stupid, you don't know what you're doing?\"  They're just a regular: sit, then try to steal the money from the budget.  It's called corruption. And I see all these roads, in New York, I'm not looking from just [the] perspective of like [a] simple idiot who doesn't know how to build the roads \u2014 I'm professional, I know how to build the roads \u2014 and I saw [in] 2019, on a Brooklyn expressway, there was building [of] two ramps, it's like 500 feet, building completely new, for six months, and a level did not match by like eight inches.  They tried to connect to ramp to the main Brooklyn express; the level didn't match [by] like eight inches.  They just demolish everything, and start building again from over. It's like, \"Excuse me.  You just spent [the] whole budget, and doing [it] again, what does this mean?\"  It's like, you engineered, your blueprint was non-effectual, or what's wrong?  And when I was spoke with other people, it's not only one example in New York.  A lot of examples, a lot of\u2014because I'm living in Manhattan, I can see repairing the roads like [the] first time again.  They did repair two years ago, and they just repair it again.  It's like, \"Excuse me.  Why [do] you waste a lot of money?  And the quality with doing this repair, is, like, horrible!\" We do have Department [of] Transportation, Polly Trottenberg, for eight years, and she's done [a] horrible job.  Horrible.  I'm a driver.  I'm driving every day [in] like a regular car, like a truck.  And I know...Manhattan Bridge, Brooklyn Bridge, Brooklyn Expressway \u2014 Manhattan, Bronx, Queens \u2014 all this road: horrible.  Nothing just like pothole repair; in [the] condition [of] who do[es] this job, I don't know who signs in contracts.  Was this like a construction company, they do not have experience, or they're just like not qualif[ied] for this job. And more important: if you['re] Department of Transportation, you have to sign [an] agreement.  If you're doing a bad job, you have to repair.  Because, how are you going to get paid for [a] bad job?  If you do a new job for interview[ing] me, and it's like probably, your boss gonna like \"oh, we're not going to pay you because it does nothing.\"  Same thing.  This person, Department of Transportation, Polly Trottenberg, they got moved up in Washington DC at a high position.  It's like, that's a horrible job in New York, are you guys in DC completely idiots to hire this person, or something is corrupt.  Same thing with the Mayor. And if you start pointing each one corner in New York, you will be surprised.  Like, for example, all these candidates who are running like \"I have experience, I built so many low-income houses\", they didn't do anything, you just negotiated with landlords when you change the zoning from like twenty-story building to forty-story building and asking \"give me ten, twenty apartments\" and they give you ten, twenty apartments for low-income because you're not building anything!  For eight years in New York, low-income NYCHA [New York City Housing Authority] didn't build nothing, it's still like negotiators with landlords. In my position, I travel like New York City, we can build a lot of buildings, for high-quality luxury buildings, can sell it.  And all this profit go back to New York budget.  We say we can build, like NYCHA building, but actually residents can be like co-op, they['re] allowed to decide where the budget has to go, not like, for example, New York City to decide \"well, we have to pay that whole buildings.\"  I don't think they need any kind of painting, they have to just repair like [the] plumbing system, the electric system, and the people are in NYCHA who like co-op can decide it: \"okay, we need this first and then this second.\"  And a lot of Mitchell-Lama did not do many more after [the] 50s-60s. I want to build this Mitchell-Lama loan, same thing.  We didn't have a clinic who wants New York City, because if you build new clinics, if you create a lot of construction job[s] to build, because the city was doing\u2014they just hired a little company with a high-quality payroll and have wasted money again!  If you just hire New York City employers to create the New York City jobs, and start building, like, New York City clinics.  You can hire a professional physician, all these doctors.  It's when we create more jobs, and all these jobs are going to be get paid for New York.  It's a simple way: stop wasting money for all these big billionaires; you just put a lot of infrastructure money to these billionaires!  We can do that for citizens' sel[ves], to help oursel[ves].  That's my policy. Just like, I'm doing this from my view, because I'm living every day, one more day on the street, with these problems on the street.  I understand what's going on.  Most of New Yorkers just see something wrong, it's like \"oh, I don't know what's happened, I don't like it\".  But they never focus  what's the problem.  What's exactly the base of the problem. ((WN))  Your web site has said \"I do not want to defund police - but retrain.\"  Could you please elaborate on that? ((Vitaly Filipchenko))  Oh, simple way!  You have information about, like, what's going on right now in New York.  A lot of, it's called 'hate crime', but if you be [specific], what does [it] mean, 'hate'?  It mean[s], hate Asian; it's mean[t] for the basic information.  What they say 'hate crime', it mean[s] Asian people hate Asian people, but it's not.  Right now in New York City, most of 90 per cent [of] black people are completely destroying Asian people, and it's mean[ing] it's not 'hate crime', it's actually a racist crime.  I have to be specific, and I have to call [a] specific name [for] what's going on, and they try to cover this and for this to know it's just 'hate crime'. Not possible, 'hate crime'.  It's a completely racist crime!  Because most of them, who [are] doing this act, it was like a different ethnicity [of] people.  It's a, obviously, race crime.  And to find out with this problem, you have to put more officers to work, [it] means you have to pay overtime, and to pay more officers, for example, if you go every day and there's, say, like ten thousand officer[s], you have to put in fifteen thousand, because you have to be undercover, you have to be [taking] more shift[s], you have to be [spending] more time on the job to stop this crime. If you want to defund police, how are you going to stop the crime?  It's like Catch-22: we want to defund police, but we need more security on the streets.  That doesn't work.  And I say it's like \"no, it's not defund police, you have to retrain.\"  Because in my opinion, [a] bad person has to be in a bad place; a good person has to be in a good place.  It doesn't matter if police officer, or just regular citizen.  If you do something wrong, you deserve to be in the wrong place.  Same thing with police!  If you're not deserv[ing] to be a good officer, excuse me, we have to fire you.  I have to get trained-better police officers; it's better quality. [In] most of [the] states, for example Vermont, Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina, District [of] Columbia, a police officer has to pass [a] physical exam every six months.  For example, you have to run in 1.7 miles on the time.  If you look at the New York police officer?  Obviously, after three years, in auxiliary police [officers], I can see half of them cannot run.  It means they [are] not physically trained for this job.  And if you can see, I'm not gonna blame.  I want to say the systems are really bad.  And if you try to stop any kind of crime, you have to be physically prepared.  And what [do] police officers do?  They start shooting.  Because they're afraid!  They're not physically prepared for any kind of physical violation.  They cannot prepare any kind of physical fight: martial arts, boxing, kickboxing, because they don't have experience. If a person [is] really sick, what's he gonna do, if they have a power?  Just going to shoot you.  Simple answers.  And I saw a lot of New York police: overweight, and not ready for any kind of physical activity.  That's a big problem.  New York State, they['re] screaming \"we Democrats, we['re] for democracy\", not actually, not guys.  You['re] just hypocrites.  They try to blame everyone except themselves. ((WN))  How do you plan to, in your words, \"support small businesses with rent law changes\"? ((Vitaly Filipchenko))  Oh, I told everybody.  When it was a[n] epidemic\u2014COVID-19 problems, I told everybody [a] simple way, because I was trying to volunteer [for] New York City Cares: it's a food distribution from the city from volunteers, from donors who, like, small business owners that needed the food.  Now obviously food bank[s]: not bad, not bad, but again, it's a canned food, not a lot of good food.  And, in my opinion, back in the time, [the] city can make a contract with all small business restaurants.  Together, for example, for one period [of] time, from like 8am to 10pm, [the] city will pay money for, like, breakfast or lunchtime for homeless people, who lost a job or [have] low-income.  People can get [a] normal meal, and in [the] late time, all these restaurant[s] can [be] working like regular restaurants, and you can make your profit and money. Because you can see a lot of businesses were shut down, because they can't survive.  In my opinion, it's completely mismanagement with small businesses.  We just can sign the contract.  First of all, we can help these people who really struggle with food; they can get a good-quality food.  It's like what all deserves. ((WN))  How do you plan to, in your words, \"Build back a greener, fairer city\"? ((Vitaly Filipchenko))  First of all, you should notice [the] city's like a cement jungle: a lot of asphalt, a lot of cement.  And again, if you notice, we do a lot of bus lane and bike lane, and a lot of people know it's really toxic paint.   When you do this painting, you can make it worse for [the] environment.  And most important, when you're planning bike lanes, bus lanes not correctly, you create your traffic contractions.  When you create your traffic contractions, what's happening?  A lot of oxocarbons coming from the cars, a lot is congestion and it's going to be worse. People say like \"oh, we got the bikes, that's safe\".  No, because we still have stores, we still have deliveries, we still have truck[s that] have to deliver with food, have to deliver it [with] any kind of supplies, material, but where's he going to park?  That's no way to find the parking.  That's really [going to] have to double park, triple park, and blocking in the street, and it cause[s] congestion.  And the people still like to stop because they have to deliver, they have to support small business.  But city can't violation, one, second, well, it's a big traffic, sort of with conjunction with oxycarbonite.  This means there was planning completely not, how would [I] say in really nice way...completely stupid. Because I see all this planning was like, they created, okay, for example, if you notice a lot of parking spots for trucks, for cars, for deliveries, it was [a] parking zone.  But, because restaurant[s were] struggling, they put in extra seats from the parking spots.  It means they took all the parking spots for cars, but the cars have to deliver the food, and they have to plan, where they have to park?  Nowhere.  It's deteriorated worse and worse, this was planning completely stupid.  If you plan in [a] correct way it deserves, like different countries Norway, like British, you can see exactly how the location [of] the parking spot.  How [it's] allocated all this green zone. If you put in a lot of bushes, if you plant in a lot of green trees, and then you make it a better environment.  If you create it like [a] sidewalk over the road, nothing across the road like a lot of China, Korea and Japan, they created crosspasses over the road.  It's like small parks, each one intersection is like [a] tiny park with the trees, with benches, and it's [safe]!  People can cross over the road, and they have to cross the road, they go over the path, there's a small\u2014tiny parks, it's a great idea [that] already exists in China, and in different countries. And I was planning the same thing to create in New York City but again, all these candidates [are] screaming \"I'm going to put in four billion dollars on the parks\", \"I'm going to put ten billion over that\", guys.  You just drop the name and numbers.  You never offered any kind of specific job.  Like for example, I live in New York City, Manhattan, where you have East Side Park.  And now Mayor put it in the budget 1.2 billion dollars to renovating the park.  But [the] park is functional.  It exists, and I'm running every Sunday there.  It's working really good, but you want to do the repair, idiot.  There really exists this park, you have to create a different one which does not exist and will, like for example Bronx, Queens, they need more parks for people.  Why focus all big money for little Manhattan? And to figure out exactly where is the problem, where the problem is actually that we have the big pollution.  Then you have to create a park in that area.  Over here, what they're doing is just try to create it, like, new park, and new park is bad, and they see like all this rail and space to high landlords, therefore the price skyrocket[s].  Because he got a better park, he got more trains.  Same with Andrew Cuomo.  He tried to create a more normal train station.  We already have enough train stations.  Like family, four years ago they built four extra stuff for Q trains, they spent four billion dollars.  For four billion dollars, you can buy Stuyvesant-Cooper with the 20 thousand apartments for [the] same price.  20 thousand apartment[s], you can put all these people who [need] a low-income property.  To pay it all, it's a lot of apartments. And I see all this planning, what's going on in New York, it's just like it's a waste of money.  They['re] pretending we need to build train station, of course we do, but we've have to look with the needs first. ((WN))  Why have you decided to run as an independent candidate? ((Vitaly Filipchenko))  Because the problem is that Democrats and Republicans: they just, most of them, they say they're for people.  But actually they're not for people, they're just for money.  Because if you['re] like, for example, Andrew Yang, for example.  \"I want to help the people\".  Dude, you already got your business, you're getting millions dollars, you already spent like a hundred million dollars when you're running for President in the United States, now you're running for mayor.  Dude, you already got power, you got business, you can help them as anyone else. I don't have a power, I just to be like speak out from the people who really deserves the help.  Because I'm living in this problem, and as you guys are not living the problem!  Because they're just looking above us, because they have [a] different style [of] life, they own the apartments, they own the houses, they got assets of millions of dollars.  I'm just a regular guy!  I can speak up for everybody.  That's my main form because I try to help people, because I know the problem.  I'm living the shoot with these people. ((WN))  What has [current mayor] Bill de Blasio not done that you would like to do instead? ((Vitaly Filipchenko))  Oh first of all, he completely screwed the city.  If you remember back with COVID-19 became; he said like \"okay, guys, I give you free bus rides\" instead [of] say[ing] like \"no, no bus rides, no any kind of train\", and if I was the mayor I can say \"you know, people, you can use the bikes, like whatever Citi Bikes for free, Citi pay [to use], if you guys drive in the car, you have to work\", like for example I was talking [to] a lot of nurses and doctors.  Do you know how many tickets they got through parking violation because they have to work, they can't find the parking spot and again paying a lot of money. As for me, if you drive a new car, you got a big distance from anybody else.  It's [the virus] is not spreading out.  But back in the time, de Blasio said like \"okay guys, everyone in the MTA [Metropolitan Transportation Authority] is essential business\".  But bacteria don't care [about] essentially; you're not essential, you just spread disease.  And instead he said like \"all these busses [are] free in New York.\"  Really, and all that mentality for people, free bus can get more riders in the bus, and he obviously just spread[s] more and more COVID-19.  That's a big problem. And if you want to do essential business, okay, I understand!  Some people [don't] have a car, some people\u2014like for example, do you know many nurses live in Long Island, they have to drive their car?  A lot, a lot!  And if you try to create, you have to do, for example, like China, Korea or Russia.  What['ve] they done?  They created more jobs, they put a person who was working on a station to check your temperature, and if you see the high fevers like, if you necessarily have to go back home, you cannot spread the fever.  That's how they created the job, and that is how they stop the spread. Because I remember back, I would always wake up six in the morning, I walk in flat six stor[ies], and I see [it] packed: whole train, whole bus, was packed.  Even right now, even two months, five months, six months, because I wake up, I'm working to go work by the train, by the bus.  And I see it's completely packed. If you want to do a better job, you can send to people who can do like, you know, like cashiers, or like managers of like jet skis, like excuse me guys, in this wagon: 20 people, next wagon please, 20 people.  To get the distance.  Back in the time, why this was so horrible, COVID-19 struck in New York with people spreading through the empty [space] in their busses because nobody came [at] a distance.  That was bad, bad, horrible, it was [a] bad job for a mayor, and bad job for Governor Cuomo.  Both of them did a horrible job. ((WN))  Who did you support in the 2017 New York City mayoral election, if anyone? ((Vitaly Filipchenko)) : 2017?  One time I think...2017...'17 I don't remember, but the first one [when] de Blasio came, I was supporting him, I didn't know him better, and obviously it was my big mistake.  I was thinking \"okay, nice family, good guy\", I was then from his house.  Then later [by a] couple months, I was like \"nope!  Same, same corruption.\" Because you know, some people, they pretend, it won't help.  But when you get more information\u2014because most of them, you can see information [for] any kind of candidate because they got more money, so they can post themselves but from better sides.  But like for example, like immigrants like me, they get marginalised.  Because why do I have to put \"simple guy\" to be a mayor?  Because [the] one per cent in New York City, they never get to problem, because rich people want to say in New York, they feel good.  All these guys who is represent[ing] New Yorkers, they [are] the one per cent.  You got [a] high-payroll job, got tons of money.  Guys, you don't know the problem, how do you know it helps the poor person, if you never live in his shoes? That's a big problem.  Because I came here in this country.  Tourist visa.  Overstayed, not legal.  [I] was afraid to get kicked out by ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement].  Then I got married, and [got] green cards, then I got citizenship, then I got my company.  I run [a] moving business for ten years.  Every day working hard, every day on the street I know what's going on, what kind of problem. This was my main idea because I know the problems.  I'm not conceived from any kind of paper, or statistic, or anywhere in [a] computer.  No, I really live this problem.  Other guys?  They try to pretend to be living the problem.  But you never know the problem.  How do you [be] like a person who's struggling for food, trying to listen for Uber Eats.  Since right now, same thing. ((WN))  Who did you support in the 2018 New York State gubernatorial election, so, the one for governor, basically? ((Vitaly Filipchenko)) : No, I did not support anyone. ((WN))  Who did you support in the 2020 presidential election, if anyone? ((Vitaly Filipchenko)) : Secret information, private information. ((WN))  You lived in Russia, so, who did you support in the 2018 Russian presidential election, if anyone, if you want to say? ((Vitaly Filipchenko)) : I [did] not vote that time. ((WN))  Well yes, but did you support anyone, any one candidate? ((Vitaly Filipchenko)) : I cannot tell all the full information, because it can be really bad for my family because they're still in Russia. ((WN))  New York City has been notorious for being one of the heaviest-affected cities at the start of the pandemic, and still the city has over 930 thousand total reported cases of COVID-19 [and] over [32] thousand deaths.  How will you address this, if elected? ((Vitaly Filipchenko)) : Okay, first of all, you have to give the full information.  If you remember Dr Fauci, he said \"oh, we don't have enough PPE [personal protective equipment], we don't enough supplies, oh, guys, don't use your mask, we need this mask for all these nurses.\"  It's a big mistake, big mistake.  When he opens his mouth, people [are] like \"okay, we don't have to\", and it was really ridiculously spreading out.  Because if you get a high position, even open your mouth, you have to think about twice, but he did not think about. Because I spoke [to] a lot of Russian doctors, American doctors, skilled professionals; because if you do any kind of procedure, you have to put it in mask.  You go to your patient, you write it down: information, you check this person, then you get out from the room.  You take it (mask) off, and throw [it] away because [it's] already hazard material.  You cannot go, with this mask, in a different room. And back in the time, they didn't give you full information: how to operate it, what they have to do; because a lot of people [don't] know to put it, gloves, how taking off this gloves.  Because when I was an auxiliary, I was training for CPI, and they explained how to use the mask, how [to] use the glove[s], how taking off this gloves.  But this high-quality position person got access for TV, never [gave] you free classes [to] explain how this work[s], how to use your mask because I will see on the street people holding the cell phone, MetroCard, put it in the\u2014second, swipe it, put it in the pocket, and still using gloves.  Guys, you cannot touch this stuff in the gloves and put it in the pocket because when you're coming back home, you pull it out [of] your wallet without gloves, and all this bacteria going to spread it out. Another big problem: most of the foreign countries, they did sanitise the street.  They did [it] using, like, UV light, they've been using special spray[s] on the street because when you walk, where usually goes the virus?  It's on the ground.  And you step in your shoe, whatever you got the mask, whatever you got any kind of gloves, you're going to bring them home in your shoes.  But other countries, they're doing better because they did disinfect the stret.  New York City [has] done nothing because they['re] like \"oh, we want to put more money over there, over there\", but it didn't do exactly the job what it needs. Even they started disinfecting [the] MT[A] after six, seven months later, is it like, ridiculously stupid? ((WN))  How will you help racial and ethnic minorities, if elected? ((Vitaly Filipchenko)) : Again, I will tell it a simple way.  All these people who [are] working really hard, deserve the better expectation for benefits, for any kind of credits, for any kind, like, loan, because right now, you can see all these big businesses get a lot of loans, regardless like tax break, but regular people who [are] working really hard, who [love] their jobs, they don't have anything! For my opinion, I would like to create a lot of extra classes: re-qualification, because if you created more green jobs, for example, [in the] community, we have to grow a lot of trees and bushes and small community gardens to get organic food, to teach the kids.  Because I grew up in Russia, everybody knows because everybody [has] a \u0434\u0430\u0447\u0430 ((ru))Russian language: \u200dcountry house when we grow, like, all these vegetables or just fruits, and we learned how to do this.  American kids [don't] know because they don't have a lot of programmes, and if you created everything back to community, to school, to give them gardens, to colleges, to any kind [of] big\u2014for example, like... And you can't see it, you got a big square roof, and you can plant the garden over there.  Any kind of building can create a small garden with that.  You can create it, more oxygen with all this green, because it's a simple, it's a biological process.  You have to put [in] more green, and if you create it to start back to community, that will be co-operation.  You can help all these people who really struggle: any kind of minority, any who's struggling for new job, we can [create] the job. Stop giving away money in jobs for big corporations; [they] already have enough money. You have to focus on ethnicity, on the people who lost [their] job.  Don't forget: New York City still [has] age discrimination.  Try to get a job: if you're wrong, you can get a job!  If you['re] getting over 50, no way!  That's a big problem.  It doesn't matter who you are: Russian, Asian, from Africa; if you're over 50, [it's] really difficult.  And if you['re] an immigrant, no, harder, because we['ve] got [a] second language.  And then, they['re] looking at nothing but like \"oh, you can't speak English.\"  Yes we can, but we got accents.\"  Doesn't matter. We saw people coming from different countries, got two or three education[s], two or three colleges.  But you know, in America, if you['re] someone [that's] got [an] accent, already it's like \"foreigner.\"  I know some people who told me on the street \"go back to your country.\"  Doesn't matter, but I'm still here because I love this country. ((WN))  Data collected by CBS News finds homeless New Yorkers are two to three times more likely to die from COVID-19 than the general population, and homeless students graduate at a sixteen per cent lower rate.  88 per cent of individuals facing homelessness in New York City are black or Latino.  How will you address the homelessness crisis, if elected? ((Vitaly Filipchenko)) : Okay first of all, again, they try to\u2014\"oh, we got a lot of homeless people\", yes, I know.  But, for example, you have to start from basic.  Each one person who is on the street homeless [is] because they lost their job.  It's like thirty per cent: thirty per cent are getting drugs, thirty per cent have got some kind of issue previously.  For me, that's what I said: we have to create new jobs. We have to participate each one person who loves their job, retrain and give one more chance to get a new job.  That's why my plan to build new houses using people for the city, that's when I created [for the] city: more jobs.  Because you're going to get more salary, you're going [to] get more insurance and they get medicine.  That's when I'm planning to build medical buildings and, as they build on by city, it's like if you created more jobs, all these people from the homeless, they can get retrained. Most important for me: all these college students who [are] in New York, people try to\u2014\"oh, I'm going to give you for free college tuition, blah blah blah\", even Biden said that, but we have zero.  For me, honestly, I'm not going [to] promise any kind [of] free college but, I got a guarantee: if you go to New York City College, you're going to guarantee to have a job in New York City because [the] city gonna create a lot of jobs, and [it's] gonna be enough for everyone. It's like with FDR: [he] created more jobs with more money, exactly in all the cit[ies] in all the state[s], not only for people who gives this opportunity to live [a] good life, not for big corporation[s], because big corporation[s] already got enough money, why [do] they have to sign this big corporation contract if I keep creating a lot of small jobs?  Focus on the people, not on the big money. ((WN))  How will you handle the vaccine rollout? ((Vitaly Filipchenko)) : Okay, simple way.  I grew up in Russia.  Each one person in Russia know[s] vaccine is good.  What we['re] having right now, it's a misinformation from vaccine.  People like \"oh, I represent whatever, what it's called, I will beat SARS, let's do this, I represent this ethnicity, let's do that,\" this is the simple way: you have to give the classes.  Some kind of classes' information: how [does] vaccine work, it's what's better, what's worse. Because right now, people, most of people [don't] have education and they're thinking like \"vaccine is so stupid\", but if you created some kind of classes.  And again, if you created classes, you created the job: who is going to be training on these classes, who gives this\u2014provides this information for community.  I mean, we already solved two problems: we created more jobs to give better education for communities. Because right now, people, they don't care: \"oh, government always gonna lie to us.\"  And if you created this information in classes, people can believe it, what's going on.  And you have to give some kind of example, not just say \"we have to be vaccinated.\"  If you show how it's work, what is the problem and how does it solve this problem.  It's when you give information, and the people will decide better because they got better information.  Right now, we don't have any kind of information.  Why [do] they have to get this information from the governments who don't care about me?  They just offered me to put it, vaccine, but didn't explain in [a] simple way for simple people. ((WN))  If you couldn't vote for yourself, who would you vote for? ((Vitaly Filipchenko)) : I don't know, probably someone who is like similar like me, who is [an] immigrant, who understands the problem, who did in my shoes, because I cannot vote anyone else who['s] just like \"I'm going to support black and blah, brown community, blah blah blah.\"  It's a bullshit.  I want to know who person who will struggle is, because most of them, like, they get tons of money, you know, and they have alternative: if you're not gonna win, you['re] still in [a] comfortable life, with a comfortable payroll, with a comfortable community.  I need a person like me who can use it; it means like he's got only one chance to help [the] community. That's more important for me.  If you're looking back like Lincoln President, he was starting from an axe-man, the chuck in the woods, then he became like postmaster, delivering the mail for [the] community, and he would talk to each one person when delivering the mail. You have, you know, like most of these candidates, they just doing; promote themselves.  They're not really believe in our needs for people who [are] really struggling.  Because I represent like immigrants, I'm represent[ing] small business owners, I'm represent[ing] like part of police, I'm represent[ing] part of MTA because I've been in one's infrastructure, and it's always a problem.  Because I have overview in which one solution.  And other candidate[s], to be honest, they['re] dropping the cool name or any kind of programme: \"you can see with my web site one hop and step for each one day what I'm gonna do.\"  Excuse me, I want to hear you right now, simple explanation. Because people want to know how.  And when.  Because I want to see the numbers.  Because I want to know exactly how it's work, because I'm a simple guy, I'm not going to be playing like someone cannot calculate it, because I'm [an] engineer, I know how to calculate, how [to] measure it, how created this stuff.  That's what was studied in college. ((WN))  What are some reasons people might not vote for you? ((Vitaly Filipchenko)) : Some reasons?  I don't know, probably my accent.  We still have a lot of racists in New York state, we still have a lot of arrogance.  Every time I go to collect the signature[s], a lot of Democrats, they said like \"oh, [al]ready [chose] one.\"  That's like excuse me, I must get to sign my petition.  It's a petition, you just give me chance[s]. In the basic democracy, everybody get[s] the same chance to speak up, explain what they're doing, have opportunities to be on the ballot.  And these arrogant Democrats, it's like \"already [chose] one, I don't want to vote for you.\"  You're not voting for new\u2014simple explanation.  You don't know the rules.  You're ready not to represent democracy, democracy exactly are opposite.  You have to give the chance for everybody, you have to help everyone, that's how it works because democracy, when you get a process discussion, when you get across in a debate, it's coming [up with] a real, true solution.  That's how democracies work. That's always really surprising New York.  A lot of people?  \"I don't know, I love this guy, I love this guy.\"  Excuse me!  If you want to get real democracy, you have to give chance[s] for everybody, when they coming time to debate, discuss, you can figure out who is better.  Because if someone got money, okay, what is about money?  Everybody who's [a] successful businessman I'm going to ask a simple question: \"are your employee[s] union[ised] or not?\"  That's it!  Because big corporations never want to have the union guys, because union guys can be protected by government.  That's my answer. Obviously, all this who's running, they don't care, they just care [about] themself.  And if you see how [many] contributions they have I suggest it's lying, you know what contributions: you have to match one to eight?  And all these candidates got like one million, got contribution from city five million, another one got like half million, got contribution three million.  Guys, you still have money, who need[s] it? Because all this money for taxpayers who really suffer right now, who need a day, who loves the job, who cannot pay rent, you guys promised to help it and then taking this money from mentioned five, ten contributions and spend it for advertising millions?  I think it's hypocrisy.  Who try to promise our poor people, and spend money for advertising.  Is it hypocrisy? ((WN))  Which person from history do you identi- ((Vitaly Filipchenko)) : Lincoln.  It's the best, my, president. ((WN))  Anything else you would like to say, then? ((Vitaly Filipchenko)) : You're going to put in information, I'm going to say simple way: I'm a, like, regular guy, from New Yorkers.  I just wanna ask if someone wanna help me with volunteers, collect the signatures for petition, please be really welcome, because you can find my web site vitalyformayor.com; f-o-r mayor.com.  Because if you believe it, we can win.  Because simple people like me with our more important power, our votes, we can change a lot of things. Because other people, other candidates, they just buy people who collect the signature.  I'm not buying, because I don't have any money, I'm not behind any kind of big corporation, I just do it by myself.  If someone's interested and believe me, they can contact me on my web site, through my e-mail, office @ vitalyformayor.com, and please, if you can help, we can win.  We can prove it: immigrants can get job done!"}}
