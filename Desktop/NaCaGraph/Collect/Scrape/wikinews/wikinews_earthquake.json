Relief efforts, however, have been hampered by damaged or destroyed infrastructure, lack of shelter, and communications difficulties. As of today, at least 300,000 people were estimated to be homeless in the capital, according to the United Nations; the organisation reports that one in ten buildings completely collapsed due to the tremors and resulting aftershocks. The UN said it believes 45,000 to 50,000 people were killed by the quake, while Haitian President Rene Preval said that seven thousand bodies were buried in a mass grave. Port-au-Prince's main airport remained open as of today, and relief airplanes were arriving faster than they could be unloaded, prompting fears that planes could run out of fuel while waiting their turn to land. As a result, all non-military flights out of the airport were restricted. Air traffic controllers from the US were present to help handle the flow. The main port, meanwhile, was severely damaged, and unable to handle any cargo. To see more images related to the disaster, you may wish to look at the companion article Haitian earthquake: in pictures. Even with the amount of aid coming in, it is proving difficult to deliver it where it is needed; many roads have been blocked by rubble. Alejandro Lopez-Chicheri, a senior spokesman for the World Food Programme (WFP), commented: \"The roads, many of them are still to be opened, and on the ones that are open there are still people concentrated on the sides of the roads.\" He described Haiti as being \"completely on the ground\". \"This is a logistical challenge. Before the earthquake struck we were already assisting one million people here, we are considering it will be at least double that after this earthquake,\" he told the Al Jazeera news agency. The WFP has estimated that two million people will need food aid; however, only four thousand have so far been fed. \"The physical destruction is so great that physically getting from point A to B with the supplies is not an easy task,\" said a WFP spokeswoman in Geneva at a news conference. Transporting supplies was made even harder due to lack of communications. Telephone lines were down. \"There have been a lot of criticism from local authorities about the relief efforts, but in all fairness, if we could catch a break and get some communication up and running, things would go a lot faster,\" commented Louis Belanger, spokesman with the humanitarian aid group Oxfam International. Looting has also been an issue. Delfin Antonio Rodriguez, the rescue commander from adjacent Dominican Republic, said to the Agency France-Presse news agency earlier today that \"[o]ur biggest problem is insecurity. Yesterday they tried to hijack some of our trucks. Today we were barely able to work in some places because of that.\" Elisabeth Byrs, a UN humanitarian spokeswoman in Geneva described the desperation of those in the capital. \"People who have not been eating or drinking for almost 50 hours and are already in a very poor situation. If they see a truck with something, or if they see a supermarket which has collapsed, they just rush to get something to eat.\" The WFP initially reported that its warehouses in the capital were looted, but this was later retracted. WFP spokeswoman Caroline Hurford told the BBC that \"[a]pparently there were unconfirmed reports of looting taking place but once our teams got down to the dockside they were able to see that there was some mistake.\" The earthquake also destroyed Port-au-Prince's main prison. According to International Red Cross spokesman Marcal Izard, 4,000 inmates escaped the jail and are now on the city streets. \"They obviously took advantage of this disaster,\" he said. Haitian police were \"not visible at all,\" according to a UN spokesman, probably because they had to deal with lost family members and homes, further exacerbating the situation. Around 3,000 international UN peacekeeping troops were present to try to maintain law and order in lieu of the local police force. According to a reporter for Al Jazeera, frustration among Port-au-Prince's residents was increasing because they were not receiving enough help, and there was an exodus out of the city to try and find areas with more supplies. \"A lot of people have simply grown tired of waiting for those emergency workers to get to them,\" said Sebastian Walker. \"Thousands of people are streaming out of the city towards the provinces to try to find supplies of food and water, supplies that are running out in the city.\" A spokesman for the Brazilian-commanded UN peacekeeping force, David Wimhurst, also commented that \"unfortunately, they're slowly getting more angry and impatient. I fear, we are all aware that the situation is getting more tense as the poorest people who need so much, are waiting for deliveries. I think tempers might be frayed.\" Photographer Shaul Schwarz for the TIME magazine reported seeing at least two roadblocks downtown, made of rocks and corpses. \"They are starting to block the roads with bodies. It's getting ugly out there.

The people are suffering. My neighbors and friends are suffering,\" said another resident, Sylvain Angerlotte, aged 22, as quoted by the Associated Press. \"We don't have money. We don't have nothing to eat. We need pure water.\" Due to lack of buildings or shelter, many relief members were facing the same difficulties as were residents. \"Even the aid workers themselves are sleeping in cars or in tents on the streets,\" said Jamieson Davies, the international programmes director of the Caritas relief organisation, to Al Jazeera.

Muammer Erol, the provincial governor of Elaz\u0131\u011f, stated Ok\u00e7ular, Yukar\u0131kanatl\u0131 and Kayal\u0131k accounted for majority of the dead. He told CNN Turk that \"villages consisting mainly of mud-brick houses have been damaged, but we have minimal damage such as cracks in buildings made of cement or stone\". Ok\u00e7ular, the largest of the affected villages, accounted for at least seventeen of the dead. The village has a population of 800, and the majority of the dwellers live in mud-brick homes built on hillsides. About 25 to 30 houses were demolished in this village. \"The village is totally flattened,\" Hasan Demirda\u011f, local administrator, told NTV. Yadin Apaydin, the administrator of Yukar\u0131kanatl\u0131, said his village had been severely affected. \"Everything has been knocked down - there is not a stone in place,\" he told CNN's Turkey sister network, CNN T\u00fcrk. \"Many houses have collapsed.

According to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, no tsunami warning was issued, contradicting some media reports that said there was one in place. The quake's magnitude was revised down from an initial report of 7.3 on the Richter scale. \"A destructive widespread tsunami threat does not exist based on historical earthquake and tsunami data,\" the US Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said. \"However, there is the possibility of a local tsunami that could affect coasts located usually no more than a 100 km [60 miles] from the earthquake epicentre.\" The USGS reports that the epicentre was fifteen kilometres (ten miles) southwest of Port-au-Prince and 1,140\u00a0kilometers (708\u00a0miles) southeast of Miami, Florida, at a depth of ten kilometres. According to USGS analyst Dale Grant, this tremor was \"the largest quake recorded in this area\"; the last strong quake was in 1984, and had a magnitude of 6.7, he noted. \"Everybody is just totally, totally freaked out and shaken. The sky is just gray with dust,\" said Henry Bahn, an official with the US Department of Agriculture who was visiting in Haiti and a witness to the incident. \"I just held on and bounced across the wall. I just hear a tremendous amount of noise and shouting and screaming in the distance,\" he commented, as quoted by the Associated Press. According to data from the USGS, there were thirteen aftershocks after the initial tremors, the strongest of which was 5.9 on the Richter scale; seven others measured in at 5.0 or higher \u2013 all the aftershocks were 4.0 or greater. No deaths have yet been reported, but a hospital in Port-au-Prince was damaged, and a US government official said several houses fell into a ravine. An analyst for USGS in Colorado commented that there could be many deaths from an earthquake of this strength. \"I think we are going to see substantial damage and casualties,\" he said. The USGS's Mike Blanpied remarked that about three million people were impacted by the earthquake, given its location. \"This quake occurred under land as opposed to off-shore, so a lot of people were directly exposed to the shaking coming off that earthquake fault, which was quite shallow,\" he said. A lack of communications makes it difficult to ascertain what damage was done. US embassy personnel were \"literally in the dark\" due to power failures, said State Department spokesman P. J. Crowley. \"They reported structures down. They reported a lot of walls down. They did see a number of bodies in the street and on the sidewalk that had been hit by debris. So clearly, there's going to be serious loss of life in this,\" he said, as quoted by AP. A reporter for Reuters said he had seen \"dozens of dead and injured people\" amidst collapsed buildings. \"We are trying to get in touch with our people on the ground but we are experiencing communication problems, which is not unusual in a disaster such as this,\" said United Nations spokeswoman Stephanie Bunker to Agence France-Presse. Appeals for aid flooded in following the disaster. In a phone call to CNN, the Haitian ambassador to the US, Raymond Joseph, said: \"I'm calling on all friends of Haiti and people who are listening to me to please come to our aid. Today as Haiti is going through the worst day in its history I am calling for all others who got help from us in the beginning to help in support.

The February 27 earthquake and a subsequent tsunami completely destroyed Pichilemu's most coastal street and its oldest villages. Wikinews has also had access to the original design plans of the new kiosks in Pichilemu, and conducted an interview with merchant Alejandro Mella, known locally as the King of the Cochayuyo (\"El Rey del Cochayuyo\"), who lost his kiosk after the earthquake. Pichilemu is a coastal city in the O'Higgins Region of Chile, known as one of the \"best surfing spots\" in South America. Its current Mayor is Roberto C\u00f3rdova Carre\u00f1o, who was elected internally by the Councillors of the city in September 2009, after several political controversies that ended with three Mayors being displaced. The territory of Pichilemu has a surface of 7,491 square kilometers, and comprises at least 24 villages, such as Ciruelos, Rode\u00edllo and Espinillo (the latter two also severely damaged by the March 11 earthquake). Pichilemu is the most popular beach in O'Higgins Region, and many tourists visit it every summer. The earthquake took place in what is considered the \"last weekend in the summer;\" on Saturday, February 27, 2010 at 03:34 local time (06:34 UTC), while almost all Chileans were sleeping. Hours earlier, on Friday, thousands of people had arrived at Pichilemu. \"The house moved from side to side. I really thought it was going to fall. It was 3 or 4 minutes long,\" Diego Grez, a Chilean student who was in Pichilemu at the time of the quake, told Wikinews in an interview. A concert was being held at the One Discotheque when the earthquake occurred. It is said that the audience panicked and fled outside the discoth\u00e8que, and then to the La Cruz Hill. Most tourists fled outside the city right after the earthquake occurred, but many others opted to stay in the La Cruz Hill or the village of Pueblo de Viudas, which are the higher points in the city. \"Pichilemu is the symbolic beach resort in the Sixth Region [of O'Higgins], so it was not strange to even think that [during] the last weekend before the entrance to school, many people would be going to take advantage of it to take a vacation; and that's what happened,\" reported El Rancag\u00fcino, the most important newspaper in O'Higgins Region, on February 28. The only radio broadcasting in the area was Entre Olas, directed by Jorge Nasser, which also helped Pichileminians know what happened in other affected places by the earthquake, as they re-broadcasted the audio of Televisi\u00f3n Nacional de Chile (National Television of Chile). On the day of the earthquake, the station reported that a local police truck had crashed near La Cruz Hill. There was no tsunami warning, and Mayor C\u00f3rdova was away on holiday when the earthquake struck. \"Those who live in Pichilemu, and those who were visiting it, were surprised by the giant waves that annihilated its beach and reached the city's square, destroying everything on their way,\" reported El Morrocotudo on February 28. \"The most tough thing occurred when the firefighters' alarms sounded twice, and the people in the hill began to yell 'tsunami!',\" journalist Tania Arce told the newspaper. The earthquake destroyed one of Pichilemu's oldest and iconic buildings, the post office, which was demolished in July. The urban centre of Pichilemu was not severely damaged by the earthquake, but its subsequent tsunami caused most of the destruction. The Agust\u00edn Ross architecture in the city (three of his buildings are National Monuments of Chile) was damaged. Agust\u00edn Ross Balcony was completely destroyed. According to SHOA, the Hydrographic and Oceanographic Service of the Chilean Navy, the tsunami triggered by the earthquake first reached Pichilemu, at 03:48 (06:48 UTC). A second wave came at 04:15 (07:15 UTC). Policeman Jos\u00e9 Ar\u00e9valo was the only person to warn residents that a tsunami was approaching. Ar\u00e9valo was patrolling the Las Terrazas beach, when the earthquake occurred. He told El Rancahuaso there were around 25 people in the beach. \"Right after the quake, he noticed the sea had shrank around 500 meters inside. He took his megaphone, and shouted people should leave the place instantly.\" \"The sea is coming out! The sea is coming out!,\" he shouted. \"The warning was also preceived by nightclubs and pubs surrounding the costanera. Then, the tragedy occurred. The sea destroyed everything on its way,\" El Rancahuaso reported. \"It all was really quick. Everyone is safe, luckily [..] It's something unforgettable to me, I'm proud I saved all of those lives,\" Ar\u00e9valo added. The tsunami destroyed restaurants, hotels, kiosks, the Fishermen Store (Caleta de Pescadores), surf schools, the Agust\u00edn Ross Balcony (located right in front of the Las Terrazas beach) and houses near the costanera (the nearest street to the beach), and flooded the building of the Government of Cardenal Caro Province, the boarding school of Pichilemu, the city square (Arturo Prat Square), and the Supermarket El 9. A local worker, Ricardo Vivanco, also known as \"El Gordo\" (\"The Fat one\"), almost was killed by a tsunami, ignoring warnings by the Police and the Fire Bureau. Vivanco was drunk, and went down to the Las Terrazas beach with his friends. The wave washed him away, and was hit on the Agust\u00edn Ross Balcony's wall. His friends recorded a video and uploaded it to YouTube. It was reported by Radio Entre Olas on February 27, that the tsunami had provoked massive damage in Punta de Lobos, Pichilemu's most popular beach. The owner of Entre Mar, an hotel and restaurant in that beach, said the tsunami had destroyed all of his buildings there. The village of Espinillo was badly damaged, and approximately 600 people were made homeless by the earthquake, Teletrece reported on March 16. \"We are keeping the government informed, we're also organized with some churches [sic, religious organizations] that are working voluntarily in Espinillo, Los Boldos, Alto Ram\u00edrez [...] We thank a lot their work, that is not to give them mediaguas [temporary tenements], but something definitive, but I also think they need resources to do it,\" Mayor C\u00f3rdova said. On March 11, Chile was hit by a second earthquake, that reached a magnitude of 6.9, and that occurred 40 kilometers southwest of Pichilemu. It occurred at 11:39 local time (14:39 UTC), while the new President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era was sworn in. A tsunami warning was issued by SHOA, between Coquimbo and Los Lagos regions. People in Pichilemu fled again to La Cruz Hill. Military authorities assured people in the hill they were going to be safe there, and that it was unlikely a tsunami was going to hit again Chile's coast. The tsunami warning was lifted at 15:50 local time (18:50 UTC). People stayed in La Cruz Hill for a longer time than after the previous earthquake, and several activities were made there, such as a concert by Chilean-Brazilian singer Joe Vasconcellos. People were also given food, wood (mostly remains from the destroyed kiosks), and electricity. \"We are here because we fear about our safety. We don't want it [a possible tsunami] to catch us. We have to settle down here and to accommodate,\" Edith Larra\u00edn told to Wikinews. Mayor C\u00f3rdova estimated that at least 2,000 people were staying at La Cruz Hill. Militaries and provincial authorities asked them to leave the hill on March 15, but most refused the deal. People eventually left the hill, due to complaints by the Mayor. On March 20, in collaboration with the Governor of Cardenal Caro Julio Ibarra, Colonel Ra\u00fal Melo, and the Mayor of Litueche Bernardo Cornejo, Mayor of Pichilemu Roberto C\u00f3rdova announced a \"tourism revival campaign\" of Pichilemu, promoting the surf practice, whose goal was \"to make the city go back to the normality.\" On April 4, the first monument was erected in memory of the earthquake and tsunami victims. The monument was created by local artisans, with rocks from several places of the Cardenal Caro Province. \"We wanted to create this monument so we don't forget it [the earthquake] [...] This is the beginning of the reconstruction,\" said Julio Ibarra. The monument was placed in front of the beach, near the building of the Cardenal Caro Government. Mayor Roberto C\u00f3rdova said that \"it definitely will help us reconstruct [ourselves] espiritually, [and that] is essential.\" On October 20, with the help of the Government, SERCOTEC (Technical Cooperation Service, Servicio de Cooperaci\u00f3n T\u00e9cnica) and FOSIS (Solidarity and Social Investment, Fondo de Solidaridad e Inversi\u00f3n Social), the Fishermen Store (Caleta de Pescadores) began to be reconstructed. Caleta de Pescadores is administered by the Independent Labour Union of Fishermen of Pichilemu (Sindicato de Trabajo Independientes de Pescadores Artesanales), which has twenty-three members. \"The Government of President Sebasti\u00e1n Pi\u00f1era has been worried about the fishing area, carrying out several actions in help of them, after all that they've suffered after the earthquake and tsunami that hit them [...] This area is working normally again,\" Governor Ibarra said. On October 6, the Municipality of Pichilemu published the design of kiosks that were going to be constructed, as replacement of those destroyed by the earthquake. As of October 23, four kiosks have been constructed in Pichilemu, specifically on Las Terrazas beach, and two more are being constructed. According to Mauricio Grez, a construction engineer, the construction of one kiosk would cost up to US$ 2,500 (CLP 1,000,000). Alejandro Mella, locally known as \"el Rey del Cochayuyo\" (\"the King of the Cochayuyo\"), is a merchant of Pichilemu, who promotes the cochayuyo (durvillaea antarctica), and lost his kiosk after the February earthquake and tsunami. \"I was given my [former] kiosk by the Mayor Orlando Cornejo, back in 1993. It was right in front of us [in front of Las Terrazas beach, near \"the grotto of the Virgin\"], and was made smithereens by the tsunami,\" he told Wikinews. \"I have always worked on selling cochayuyo here, and the terrain where my kiosk was located before has been disputed by private people, and the municipality approved that. I talked with the Mayor and he said 'I don't know what's going on the beach'; that left me perplexed. [...] I like the new design of the kiosks, they are larger, and we can do more things with it, but they are way too expensive,\" he added. Mr. Mella also gave Wikinews a sample of his work as \"the King of the Cochayuyo\", an essay called \"El cochayuyo es una mina repleta de nutrientes y sales minerales\" (\"Cochayuyo is a mine full of nutrients and mineral salts\", pictured below), which he sells for 200 Chilean pesos (0.41 US$), and that contains \"tips and information about the plant, and some recipes.\""}, "3-24": {"heading": "Major earthquake strikes Peru followed by multiple large aftershocks ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Major_earthquake_strikes_Peru_followed_by_multiple_large_aftershocks", "date": "16-August-2007", "text": "According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) a major earthquake with a magnitude of 7.9 has struck just off the coast of Peru followed by 16 aftershocks  with magnitudes ranging from the lowest of 4.5 and the highest of 6.3.

The first article builds upon the idea that analysis of the first seismic waves from an earthquake can provide a way to generate a several second warning that an earthquake will hit. However, for such warnings to be useful, the early seismic waves should also allow prediction of the strength of the earthquake. An article published in this week's edition of Nature concludes that scientists might be able to distinguish small earthquakes from big ones by using the very first second of information contained in seismic waves. Researchers from the University of California, Berkeley, say the measurements of seismic waves soon after a trembler can signal whether it will be a minor or monster trembler. \"Basically, a high-pitched squeal means that you'll get a smaller quake. A low-groan means something bigger,\" says the University of California's Richard Allen. In the study, Allen and colleagues analyzed records of 71 major Pacific Rim quakes in the past decades including 24 events that were greater than a magnitude 6. Using a mathematical model, they were able to estimate a quake's size to within one magnitude unit from as little as four seconds of data of the frequency of the energy in the primary wave. These low-energy waves typically cause a jolt, signaling the occurrence of a quake. According to a traditional theory, called the cascade model, we cannot know anything about an earthquake's ultimate magnitude until it is finished. This is because spread along a fault line depends on the stress in each individual part of the fault. Given that this information is not available to the initial rupture point, it should be impossible to tell from that first slip how far it will go or how long it will last. The study by Berkeley's Allen and Erik L. Olson of the University of Wisconsin-Madison builds upon earlier work by Yutaka Nakamura in Japan. Nakamura's research indicated that the frequency of the P wave can allow prediction of which earthquakes will have a magnitude greater than 6 and distinguish them from small tremors that do not require warnings. Some fire stations use P wave detectors to automatically open doors in an effort to make sure that emergency vehicles are not trapped inside by doors that can be jammed shut by earthquake damage. The goal of this research is to make the best possible use of the information from the earliest seismic waves emitted by an earthquake as part of an alert system to give seconds to tens of seconds of advance notice of an impending quake -- enough time for schoolchildren to take cover, power generators to trip off and valves to shut on pipelines. A major limitation of this work is that the greatest earthquake damage is near the epicenter where there is little time difference between the early P waves and the strongest damaging earthquake waves. The second research paper, published this week in the scientific magazine Physical Review Letters, builds upon earlier research into patterns of earthquake activity at specific faults. The new research by scientists from Israel and Germany led by Prof. Shlomo Havlin, of Bar-Ilan University's Department of Physics in Israel, concerns prediction of the timing between earthquakes. Prof. Havlin's research, in collaboration with Prof. Armin Bunde, of the Justus-Liebig University in Giessen, Germany, and Bar-Ilan University graduate student Valerie Livina, involved a large number of past earthquakes at many different faults.  The data used in this study were for earthquakes ranging from magnitude 2 to magnitude 5.5 on the Richter Scale. Data were from several areas of the world including California, Japan, and New Zealand. The new results are consistent with previous studies which have indicated that some faults have more frequent small earthquakes while other faults have less frequent and larger earthquakes."}, "3-28": {"heading": "8.9 magnitude earthquake hits Japan, causes tsunami ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/8.9_magnitude_earthquake_hits_Japan,_causes_tsunami", "date": "11-March-2011", "text": "A massive 8.9 magnitude earthquake occurred in northern Japan early on Friday.

The meteorological department has warned people in coastal areas in southern India to stay away as there are possibilities of more waves due to after-shocks for the next 3 to 4 days.[25] In addition to the large number of local residents, numerous tourists vacationing during the busy Christmas holiday travel season were among the victims. In a press conference on December 31, Swedish prime minister G\u00f6ran Persson reported that the number of Swedes that are confirmed dead is 59 and the number of missing Swedes is 3 559. Most of these were on vacation in Thailand, primarily in Khao Lak and Phi Phi Island. As of December 31, 2004, the death toll is estimated by the United Nations to be up to 150,000. However, water-borne diseases are expected to kill nearly twice as many people. The quake was initially reported at magnitude 6.8 but soon upgraded to 8.5, and then 8.9 and finally 9.0.  The largest recorded earthquake was the Great Chilean Earthquake of 1960, at magnitude 9.5. The hypocenter was measured at 3.298\u00b0N, 95.779\u00b0E, some 160 kilometres west of Sumatra, at a depth of 10 km underwater, within the \"Ring of Fire\" zone of frequent earthquakes. The quake was felt as far away as Bangladesh, India, Myanmar, Malaysia, Maledives Singapore and Thailand. The earthquake was unusually large in geographical extent. 1,125\u00a0km (700\u00a0mi) of faultline slipped 15\u00a0m (50\u00a0ft) along the subduction zone where the India Plate dives under the Burma Plate. This formed a shock wave in the Indian Ocean, creating tsunamis that traveled at up to 800\u00a0km/h (500\u00a0mi/h). Numerous aftershocks of between magnitude 5.7 and 6.1 were reported off the Andaman Islands in the following hours.  Aftershocks off the Nicobar Islands were also reported, including ones of magnitude 7.3 [26], and 6.5 [27].  (See USGS current earthquake information.) Based on one seismic model, some of the smaller islands southwest of Sumatra have moved southwest up to 20 m (66 ft).  The northern tip of Sumatra, which is on the Burma Plate as opposed to the southern regions on the Sunda Plate, may also have moved southwest up to 36 m (120 ft).  Other models suggest that most of the movement would have been vertical rather than lateral.  Further measurement is needed to determine the nature of the actual movement.  The massive release of energy and shift in mass also caused the earth to wobble slightly on its axis. One year ago to this day, over 30,000 Iranians were killed by an earthquake with a 6.6 magnitude. The Indian Ocean Earthquake came just three days after a magnitude 8.1 earthquake in a completely uninhabited region off Macquarie Island near Antarctica. Earthquakes above magnitude 9 occur, on average, only about once every twenty years. Large amounts of humanitarian aid are needed due to widespread damage to infrastructure, food and water shortages and economic damage to the fishing and tourism industries. Epidemics are of special concern, as they are highly likely due to the high population density and tropical climate of the affected areas.  The United Nations has stated that the largest relief operation in history is underway. The overwhelming concern of humanitarian and government agencies is to quickly identify and bury the dead before they become a health issue and contribute to the spread of diseases such as cholera, diphtheria, dysentery and typhoid (according to widespread but misguided belief The Times).  Other high priorities are delivery of medical supplies and personnel to overwhelmed hospitals and clinics, tent shelters and clothing to people who have lost their houses and belongings, and potable water.  Many usual sources of water were spoiled either by salt water, broken by the force of the tsunami, or contaminated with bodies of dead people or livestock, requiring water purification equipment or trucking potable water into the affected region. Governments and humanitarian organisations around the world are scrambling to offer aid and technical help after the quake and tsunamis that killed thousands of people in southern Asia and northwest Africa and caused wide-spread devastation. The World Bank estimates the amount of aid needed at USD 5 billion.

Richard Gross, a scientist at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, computed how the globe's rotation should have been altered by the earthquake; he and fellow scientists determined that the day had been shortened by approximately 1.26 microseconds (a microsecond is one millionth of a second). Gross commented about his findings to the Bloomberg news agency in an email, saying: \"[t]he length of the day should have gotten shorter by 1.26 microseconds. The axis about which the Earth\u2019s mass is balanced should have moved by 2.7 milliarcseconds (equal to approximately eight centimeters or three inches).\" Gross compared the Chile earthquake with the 9.1 magnitude Sumatra earthquake in 2004 which generated a tsunami. According to him, that temblor shortened the day by 6.8 microseconds and moved the axis by about 2.3 milliarcseconds. The scientist noted that the Chilean earthquake moved the Earth's axis more than the Sumatran one, despite not being as strong for two reasons. The first, he said, is because it was located in the mid-latitudes of the globe, which made it more effective in altering the axis. The other reason was that the Chilean earthquake fault was steeper than that in Sumatra, which results in more vertical motion and thus more change in the figure axis. In an interview with Bloomberg Radio, David Kerridge, the head of Earth hazards and systems at the British Geological Survey in Edinburgh, Scotland, described how the earthquake may have caused such a change in the axis. \"It\u2019s what we call the ice-skater effect,\" Kerridge  explained.  He then described how when an ice skater executes a spin, if the skater pulls in his or her arms, the skater's rate of spin will increase. \"It\u2019s the same idea with the Earth going around.  If you change the distribution of mass, the rotation rate changes.\""}, "3-47": {"heading": "Strong earthquake strikes Indonesia ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Strong_earthquake_strikes_Indonesia", "date": "26-July-2007", "text": "According to the United States Geological Survey (USGS) a strong magnitude 6.9 earthquake has struck Indonesia in the Molucca Sea approximately 220 kilometers (135 miles) north of Ternate, Maluku Islands, Indonesia at a depth of 44.6 kilometers (27.7 miles).

The earthquake centered around Awaji Island, near the city of Kobe. It measured 7.3 on the Richter Scale, the biggest quake to hit Japan since World War II. Though a great earthquake could theoretically occur in any part of Japan, and scientists had warned of the possibility of earthquakes in the Kansai region, citizens and local government tended to be unaware of this possibility 10 years ago.  The death and destruction caused by the quake gave a serious shock to the city's residents.  One story of the Kobe city hall was totally destroyed, and a part of Meishin Highway between Nagoya and Kobe was ripped apart; a bus barely avoided falling from the broken highway.  Engineers buttressed vulnerable city structures throughout Japan after the earthquake. Research revealed that architecture designed under national earthquake-proof standards had survived the earthquake. Many old buildings were rebuilt, reconstructed, or given structual support. Vulnerable city infrastructure was also attended to; in some areas water and fuel supply had been disrupted for over two months. Many municipalities reviewed their standards for civil engineering design. The earthquake also revealed systematic vulnerability within the Japanese government. The prime minister at that time, Tomiichi Murayama, first learned of the earthquake from a TV news program two hours later, and not from a government report.  He called his secretary, who also knew nothing of it.  The government improved these weaknesses, and in the case of the Chuetsu Earthquake in October 2004, the prime minister's office was able to quickly deal with the accident. After the earthquake, many people spent days in shelters. 104,900 houses were completely destroyed, and 144,256 only partly desroyed. The Hyogo prefecture and municipalities provided temporary shelters, called Kasetsujutaku. Such temporary houses had remained since 2000. Since those houses were provided to individuals and not to communities, many people found they were no longer with their familiar neighbors after moving. This caused serious problems among people, especially the elderly. Since 2000, around 200 people have died alone in such temporary houses, to be found only days later; this was considered a serious social problem.  A word was even coined for this situation, Kodokushi (meaning \"death in solitude\" in Japanese), but some say no effective solution has yet been offered. The earthquake has also had a bright side. Before the earthquake, it was not popular to participate voluntarily in social activities in Japan. The earthquake moved many people to join such activities. Since it was close to the end of the Japanese schoolyear, many students could stay in the affected area for long days. And it has been not easy to have a vacation for Japanese workers, as many people took vacations from their company and went to the affected area to help out.  This was not just a temporary movement, but influenced people to consider such social engagement as a regular activity (one can see a similar  influcence in the case of the Chuetsu Earthquake)."}, "3-57": {"heading": "Magnitude 7.4 earthquake strikes Mexico; no fatalities reported ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Magnitude_7.4_earthquake_strikes_Mexico;_no_fatalities_reported", "date": "21-March-2012", "text": "A significant earthquake has impacted Mexico on a part of the coast bordering the Pacific Ocean.

A statement from a state governor in Guerrero reported damage to five hundred houses in the state. In the capital Mexico City, a pedestrian bridge was also reported to have collapsed, crushing a minibus in the process. In the substantially impacted Mexican state of Oaxaca, one witness named Sylvia Valencia described the earthquake as \"hard\", \"strong\" and \"long\". Irma Ortiz, another witness from the same state, said of the quake: \"It was very strong, but we didn't see anything fall\". A Spanish language tweet from Mexico president Felipe Calder\u00f3n spoke of \"scenes of panic and building evacuations\".

The last such incident was 1999 in Duzce, Turkey where a 7.4 magnitude quake was followed by a 7.1 magnitude quake three months later. In the Nature report, the researchers pointed to evidence suggesting that stresses in the fault near northern Sumatra were significantly higher than those of the 1999 Turkey rupture.

Geoscience Australia says the offshore quake registered 5.3 on the Richter scale. No damage has been reported in the city of Darwin or the community of Port Keats which is the nearest town to the quake's epicentre in a region known for its moderate seismicity. The quake's epicentre was located 500 kilometres west-north-west of Darwin in the Banda Sea. The earthquake hit at 9.51am (CDT). Geoscience Australia (the government's geological organisation) says the region may be unstable for a few days and aftershocks or another quake may be felt. Duty seismologist, Dr Svetan Sinadinovski, says it was a shallow quake and the subterranean make-up of the area allowed the tremor waves to travel to Darwin without losing much energy. He says the quake was on Australia's continental shelf, which is a common place for seismic activity. \"That is the area where Australian plate collides with Asian plate and that extends through the Indonesian islands up to Sumatra and Thailand in the north and east through PNG to Tonga and New Zealand,\" he said. \"Preliminary reports point to a 5 to 6 in the Darwin region - this means that the earthquake would have been felt by almost everyone indoors according to the Modified Mercali Scale which measures the impact of seismic waves on structures.\" \"People would have felt this earthquake up to 500km away from the epicentre, and we have heard numerous reports of residents in the Darwin area having felt the effects of the event,\" he said. Among those who felt the quake were participants involved in the trial of Bradley John Murdoch in the Northern Territory Supreme Court in Darwin -  where chairs and TVs shook in the court building. The Bureau of Meteorology's Darwin office was also shaken, but no reports of damage have been received by police. \"We felt it - I felt the building sway and some of the monitors shook a little,\" the bureau's duty forecaster, Billy Lynch, said. \"We are on the third floor of a three-story building.\" An earthquake with a magnitude of at least 6.2 struck off the coast of Sumatra yesterday, triggering a tsunami alert, officials said. There were no immediate reports of a tsunami, damages or casualties. The quake's epicenter was located off Simeulue, 160 miles southwest of Medan on Sumatra's northwest coast, according to the U.S. Geological Survey(USGS). Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics Agency put the quake's magnitude at 6.2, whilst the USGS said the magnitude was 6.5. The quake rocked nearby Nias island and was felt in Medan, said an official from the Indonesian agency's Jakarta office. Simeulue island is near the epicenter of the December 26 quake that caused a massive tsunami. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii said there was no threat of a tsunami to Pacific coastlines, but quakes of this size can sometimes generate local tsunamis along coasts near the epicenter. Sumatra has been affected by strong aftershocks since the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake. Experts say the fault line is unstable and may produce another massive quake soon. The biggest earthquake to strike the region, in 1998, had a magnitude of 6.9. The largest earthquake ever recorded was in Chile in 1960. This magnitude 9.5 earthquake resulted in the death of 5,000 people. In 1976 a smaller 8.0 earthquake in China caused the death of an estimated 255,000 people. More recently, in December 2003 an earthquake in Iran resulted in the death of approximately 50,000 people. Geoscience Australia said the 5.3 quake did not generate a tsunami. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, which had a magnitude of 9.0, triggered a series of lethal tsunamis on December 26, 2004 that killed over 270,000 people, making it the deadliest tsunami in recorded history. In March 2005 another strong earthquake rocked parts of Darwin, with tremors lasting several minutes felt across the city and rural areas.

The international aid agency added that there is an urgent need for search and rescue volunteers as well as field hospitals, emergency health, water purification and telecommunications. The World Food Program (WFP), which has a large staff on the ground, says the level of destruction indicates many of these people have been affected and will require help. The Director of the WFP office in Geneva, Charles Vincent, remarked that the first priority is to save lives. \"To rescue people that are buried, that are trapped, etc. [...] followed very rapidly by a big problem of water, sanitation, epidemic-problems of diseases that might be bred in that kind of situation,\" he noted.

The UN will do whatever possible to help the Haitian people to overcome these difficulties,\" Ban stated. Ban noted that 3,000 UN peacekeepers were in Haiti, and that they secured the seaport and airport. They are trying to rescue people buried underneath rubble, he said, but were severely hampered by lack of heavy equipment. \"Brazilian forces have been working through the night to rescue but because of the darkness and destruction of infrastructure not much progress has been made. We hope it will be better this morning,\" Ban said. The aid group Oxfam added that its emergency response team for Latin America is based in Haiti and is well prepared, with a public health, water and sanitation team in Port-au-Prince. Oxfam says it is preparing to send in emergency supplies as soon as possible from Panama. The American Red Cross pledged US$500,000 to help the country, and would send out people to assess damage. \"As with most earthquakes, we expect to see immediate needs for food, water, temporary shelter, medical services and emotional support,\" it said yesterday evening in a statement.

((DG)) What is going to happen to the apartments? ((JB)) I'm not sure. It's such a shame. Imagine the pain of seeing your home completely destroyed and having to live in the court. It's terrible. ((DG)) Has the Mayor, Mr. H\u00e9ctor Valenzuela helped you? ((JB)) No, he hasn't helped us. He knows that tons of mice are coming out from sewers over there. A few days ago, someone told him that mice were coming out of the sewers. He laughed and said: \"I'll see later what I can do.\" Can you see how the water has expanded throughout the entire street? Valenzuela said that the departments have to be demolished before they can give us provisory homes (mediaguas). ((DG)) Thanks for your time and I hope you can get your home back soon.

The quake struck 260 kilometers (160 miles) North of Port Blair in the Andaman Islands at approximately 1:55 a.m. local time with a depth of 33.1km (20.6 miles). The United States Geological Survey (USGS) says it's likely the quake was an aftershock to the deadly magnitude 9.1 earthquake in 2004 that triggered a massive tsunami killing nearly 230,000 people. The warnings had applied to Myanmar, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Thailand. The NOAA indicated the risk of a tsunami was 'moderate to high', but no waves were reported in any of the areas indicated in the warning. \"Sea level readings indicate that a significant tsunami was not generated. Therefore the tsunami watch issued by this center has been canceled,\" said the NOAA earlier in a statement on its website.

A 10 inch rise in sea level was also reported in Yaizu City. As a precaution, Japanese officials have shut down at least two units, reactor No. 4 and 5 at the nuclear power facility in Hamaoka to perform a safety check. Alarms inside the plant indicated a possible radiation leak inside reactor 5, but officials say no radiation has been detected outside containment. According to Japan's Trade Ministry, both reactors shut down automatically after sensors detected the quake. Area trains have also been stopped. This was the second earthquake in Japan in two days, following an earlier one that measured 6.9 near Tokyo. There are no reports of major damage with either quake. In Japan, some windows broke and roof tiles dislodged from roofs. Spokesman for the USGS, Paul Caruso, says both quakes appear to be unrelated.
