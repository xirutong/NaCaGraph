Wikinews interviews Juana Bustamante, Chilean earthquake survivor from Paniahue. Paniahue, Santa Cruz, Chile – Wikinews' Diego Grez interviewed Juana Bustamante, a Chilean earthquake survivor from Santa Cruz, who lost her home. Juana told us her story of what she faced when the earthquake took place. The building where she was living fell down while she was on the second floor. Its first floor practically disappeared. ((Diego Grez)) Where are you living right now? ((Juana Bustamante)) We are living in tents that the military gave to us. There are 22 families here [over the court], and over there by the plum trees there are another 22, in addition to the ones that are living in the school, and some that live [over there] on the other side. ((DG)) In total, how many families do you think there are [who have lost their home]? ( (JB) ) There are apparently around 365 families. All of us are homeless. ((DG) ) What is going to happen to the apartments? ((JB)) I'm not sure. It's such a shame. Imagine the pain of seeing your home completely destroyed and having to live in the court. It's terrible. ((DG)) Has the Mayor, Mr. Héctor Valenzuela helped you? ((JB) ) No, he hasn't helped us. He knows that tons of mice are coming out from sewers over there. A few days ago, someone told him that mice were coming out of the sewers. He laughed and said: "I'll see later what I can do." Can you see how the water has expanded throughout the entire street? Valenzuela said that the departments have to be demolished before they can give us provisory homes (mediaguas). ((DG)) Thanks for your time and I hope you can get your home back soon. ((JB)) Thank you for this interview to let the world know what's happening to the common people, to the poor people. Thanks again.
