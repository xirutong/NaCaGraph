Five police officers killed in Dallas, Texas during sniper attack. On Thursday, five police officers were killed and seven were injured after a sniper attacked a public protest march in downtown Dallas, Texas. Sources indicate at least three other people were taken into custody for questioning relating to the attack. The march was held to protest the shooting deaths of Alton Sterling in Louisiana and Philando Castile in Minnesota during engagements with police officers. Police identified 25-year-old Micah Johnson as the suspect. Johnson had previously served in the US army, and police reported he said he wanted to exact revenge upon police officers after news of Sterling and Castile's deaths. Ammunition and weapons were found inside Johnson's home. Dallas Police reported the policemen were shot at from a height. Officials said two civilians were also injured in the attack. Micah Johnson served for the United States Army Reserve from 2009 until early 2015, including a tour of Afghanistan. Johnson had no criminal record.  His attack was reported to be a lone mission. After the attack earlier on Thursday, police killed Micah Johnson in El Centro College's parking lot by a bomb explosion. Hillary Clinton, 2016 United States presidential election candidate and favorite for the Democratic nomination this July, said, "There is too much violence, too much hate, too much senseless killing, too many people dead who shouldn't be. No-one has all the answers. We have to find them together." After Johnson was killed, Mike Rawlings, Dallas' mayor, said "We believe now the city is safe".
