2006 record heat wave moves across U.S. eastern seaboard. The massive surge of hot air that has plagued the West and Midwest during last week has now moved over the eastern seaboard of the United States. Residents are bracing themselves for what could be record breaking temperatures. Many cities are already struggling due to power outages from mid-July's Heat Wave, particularly some in the Queens and Staten Island in New York City. Consolidated Edison, the power supplier for the New York City area, has reported that many customers are still without power. They urge customers to lighten the load on power usage to help avoid further service interruption. Baltimore, Washington D.C. and Philadelphia are all expecting highs to reach above 100ºF (37.8ºC). The National Weather Service has posted Excessive Heat Warnings for many of the cities in the eastern seaboard that do not normally experience this type of dangerously hot weather. On Tuesday August 1, 2006 according to The Weather Channel, New York City will have a high temperature of 98ºF in Central Park, however other areas in the New York City area are expected to rise above 100ºF. Philadelphia will reach 100ºF, Washington D.C. will have a high of 101ºF and Baltimore and Richmond may see temperatures rise above the 100 mark. To exacerbate the situation, heat indices are expected to reach well over the 110s for much of the east coast due to high humidity levels. An Air Stagnation Advisory has also been issued for much of the urban areas on the eastern seaboard and "BosWash", as rain is expected to be very minimal through Thursday. Many residents say this heat is unheard of as temperatures are expected to be higher than that of Florida and some parts of Texas, where it is typically hotter. The oppressive and dangerously high temperatures will remain this way well into Thursday afternoon, according to meteorologists, when a cool front is expected to move in and provide much needed relief.
