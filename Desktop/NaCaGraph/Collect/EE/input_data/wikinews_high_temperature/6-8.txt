2-year-old dies in car in 100ºF heat with windows rolled up. A two-year-old girl was found dead inside a car yesterday in Union Township, Clermont County, Ohio The car was parked outside the Glen Este Middle School with all windows rolled up. High temperatures in the area reached 100ºF (~38ºC). Police said that the girl had been inside the car for hours before her death. A friend of the family said the child was Cecelia Slaby, however police are not reporting any personal information. The car was registered to the school's vice principal, Brenda Nesselroad-Slaby. The school staff had to report to work to prepare for the start of school next week. The family friend that identified the girl also told News 5 in Cincinnati that Nesselroad-Slaby was scheduled to attend a 7 a.m. meeting, but decided that was too early in the day to drop off Cecelia, so she ran several errands instead. The source said Cecelia likely fell asleep in the car and Nesselroad forgot about her when she did go to the school, as she usually does not care for the child in the morning. However, police have not released any specific details. The family friend described Nesselroad as "mother of the year." The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says the temperature inside a closed vehicle setting in sunlight can raise nearly 20 Fahrenheit degrees (11 Celsius degrees) in just three minutes. Another three or four minutes, and the administration says a car's temperature can reach 125ºF (~52ºC). Heatstrokes occur when the body reaches a temperature of 104ºF (40ºC). No charges have been filed. An autopsy has been scheduled.
