The report is drafted, held for 30 days of public comment, then released to the Secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) each year in April. This year's report is the ninth since the EPA began producing the emissions inventory in 1997, after the US signed and ratified the UNFCCC in 1992.  The UNFCCC, a legally non-binding treaty created to address global warming, is not as well known as the Kyoto Protocol, which is a more recently updated protocol based on that treaty.  The United States did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol; however, it was ratified by 127 other nations and went into effect for them on February 16, 2005. The EPA report covers the period 1990-2003, with particular emphasis on the 2003 period (there is a one-year delay in preparation).  Major findings include: The period beginning in 1990 is of interest, since that is the period addressed by the Kyoto Protocol, which attempts to reduce the average greenhouse gas emissions for each country to 5.2 percent below 1990 levels. Gases covered in the report included six major greenhouse gases.  The first three gases are produced both naturally and by human activity, but the last three gases are mainly produced by human activity: About 80% of the total emissions came from the burning of fossil fuels.  Other major natural greenhouse gases are water vapor (H2O), which actually traps more heat in the atmosphere than all the listed gases combined; and ozone (O3), a gas well-known for a \"hole\" in the ozone layer being discovered over the earth's polar regions in recent decades."}, "5-2": {"heading": "Scientist: Sulfur remedy for greenhouse effect backed by data ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Scientist:_Sulfur_remedy_for_greenhouse_effect_backed_by_data", "date": "17-December-2006", "text": "Nobel Prize winner Professor Paul J. Crutzen has stated he has data to support his controversial claim that injecting sulfur into the atmosphere would negate the greenhouse effect. The data is intended to quiet critics of the theory he first discussed in the scientific journal Climatic Change in August, 2006. The 1995 Nobel Prize winner in chemistry stated \"Our calculations using the best models available have shown that injecting 1 million tonnes of sulfur a year would cool down the climate so the greenhouse effect is wiped out.\" The theory uses the idea that an added layer of sulfates in the stratosphere, approximately 16 kilometres above the earth, would reflect sunlight back into space and reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface. Critics have shown that the earth has struggled for decades to reduce sulfur pollution, and how it is a component of acid rain that kills plantlife and animals. A large-scale experiment would be impossible to conduct, however scientists have noticed that massive volcanic eruptions have had similar effects on the earth. The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines lowered temperatures around the world for two years, according to data taken at the time. Crutzen resparked discussion on the topic, a theory which has been dismissed up until now as dangerous. \"Until August this was a taboo issue. But the paper I published really set off some movement in this area. It never hit the level of seriousness which it has taken in the past months,\" Crutzen said.

European states are pushing for steep reductions in emissions, but environmentalists accuse some others of dragging their feet. The European Union's climate chief, Artur Runge Metzger, says his organization wants greenhouse emissions cut by half by the middle of the century. \"We would like to see global average temperatures rise no more than an average of two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels,\" Metzger said. \"And that would require that global emissions go down by at least 50 percent of the 1990 emissions by the year 2050.\" Greenhouse emissions are thought to be causing global warming. Metzger downplayed differences between the EU and other countries on reduction targets, saying he believes the response to the 50 percent proposal has been increasingly positive. He noted that Japan, Canada and some members of the U.S. congress have expressed support for the idea. Those same countries, however, have been targeted by environmental groups, who say they have failed in their initial statements here to come out strongly enough for significant cuts. {{w|Hans Verolme]] of the group WWF says Japan is being criticized for not including binding targets in its proposal for emission control discussions. \"That in our view would be quite disastrous. It would delay action and it would in fact lead to dangerous climate change,\" Verolme said. Japan says its proposal is merely an attempt to get the conversation started, and U.N. climate change chief Yvo de Boer has also sought to downplay any differences. De Boer repeatedly points out that the Bali conference is not meant to produce a new climate-change treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol. That 1997 agreement is set to expire in 2012. \"This meeting in Bali will not finalize a post-2012 climate change deal, that's much too complicated to do in 10 days, but what it can do is put in place a two-year process to work towards such a deal,\" De Boer said.

One of the largest interactions (or \"inputs\") humans have with the atmosphere is the ever-increasing use of fossil fuels. Consumption has risen 2% per year for this decade. Fossil fuels burnt in factories and automobiles send their waste into our atmosphere in two forms. The first is CO2 and other greenhouse gases, which have received substantial attention in the last few years because of the way they trap heat in the atmosphere. The second is the tiny particles of sulfur dioxide, soot and ash, which scientists call aerosols (basically smog). Research into understanding the negative health effects of air pollution has resulted in the development of catalytic converters for cars as well as devices to remove particulate solids from industrial waste before it reaches the air. More recently, atmospheric scientists have come upon the phenomenon of the reduction of direct sunlight reaching Earth's surface\u2014 observing a nearly a 5% decline between 1960 and 1990, with evidence of a recovery since then. This has been dubbed the \"global dimming\" effect, and is probably due to the way these aerosols act upon clouds. It is important to realise that this does not represent a net loss of this much sunshine to the climate system - if so, large temperature declines would have been observed. Instead, the sunshine is absorbed elsewhere in the system, with a much smaller net loss. Clouds form when moisture gathers around airborne particles, such as pollen or dust. Clouds formed by the aerosol particles emitted by fossil fuel consumption are made of many more tiny droplets than \"natural\" clouds. These smog-created clouds have two notable effects: they shield sunlight from reaching Earth's surface and, due to water's reflective nature, the millions of tiny droplets suspended in them reflect light back into space, allowing even less light to reach Earth. Many scientists now believe that global dimming caused by these pollutants has mitigated the temperature rises brought about by global warming. Over the last thirty years, Earth's temperature has increased by about 0.5 oC. In the absence of global dimming, however, the Earth might be 0.3 oC warmer than it currently is, suggesting that a \"tug-of-war\" exists between greenhouse gases and particulates released by burning fossil fuels. Efforts to mitigate the human health dangers of smog have allowed more heat into our atmosphere and brought about a sharper increase in global warming. Dr. James E. Hansen, professor at Columbia University and the head of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies [1], believes  that if we continue on our current pattern, this warming could be as much as five degrees in the next thirty years and ten to fourteen degrees over the course of the century. Such a temperature rise would devastate life on Earth, likely bringing on a cascade of self-reinforcing warming effects. Earth's forests drying and burning, a steady thawing of the Greenland and arctic ice sheets, and, most dangerous of all, a release of the methane hydrates that are now frozen at the bottom of the oceans, could remake the planet into something inhospitable to human life. Dr. Hansen warns that, according to his research, man has just 10 years to reduce greenhouse gases before global warming and other responses to human activity by Earth's climate reach a \"tipping point\", becoming unstoppable."}, "5-6": {"heading": "US, five Asian nations announce climate change partnership ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/US,_five_Asian_nations_announce_climate_change_partnership", "date": "28-July-2005", "text": "The United States, China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Australia have formed a partnership aiming to cut the emissions of gasses that lead to global warming.

This partnership will complement and not replace the Kyoto Protocol.\" The Australian Prime Minister John Howard also said that his country should not pursue renewable technologies, but should instead concentrate in reducing emissions from the use of coal. Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal, and Howard said that \"Australia [should not be] unreasonably penalising herself by saying, in effect, we're going to try to move away from the use of fuels in which Australia has a natural advantage.\" However part of the deal includes setting up a fund to further research cleaner energy technologies, including more efficient use of fossil fuels as well as renewable technologies, and also methods of trapping and storing greenhouse gasses rather than releasing them to the atmosphere. It is hoped that this will aid China, India and other developing countries to adopt cleaner energy solutions.

Some of the issues that had still been open the day before yesterday (for example how deforestation was to be addressed and the matter of financial support for developing countries to send and support negotiators to the UN climate conferences), had apparently been addressed to everyones satisfaction during yesterdays informal talks. But the talks were still on with regard to preambular text of a document that states how further action to mitigate climate change is to be taken, the inclusion of a 25-40% range for reductions in GHG emissions for industrialized nations by 2020 from 1990 levels being contested. The draft decision proposed by the President of the Conference today however, no longer included the numbers, but did make reference to the latest report by the international body of scientists that is charged with assessing the current state of knowledge on climate change. This Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had presented its Synthesis report earlier this year."}, "5-16": {"heading": "World's biggest polluters won't cut back on fossil fuel ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/World%27s_biggest_polluters_won%27t_cut_back_on_fossil_fuel", "date": "12-January-2006", "text": "Six of the world's major polluters, who participated in this week's Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (AP6 or APPCDC), have launched a multi-million dollar fund to develop clean-energy, but stressed they will be heavily reliant on polluting fossil-fuels for generations to come. Green groups, labelling the talks a sham, have condemned the climate talks which were held in Sydney, Australia as a \"coal and nuclear pact\" between the big polluters and fossil-fuel firms. Australian climate change observers have attacked the AP6 outcomes as grossly irresponsible, saying the Federal Government is willing to accept the reality of runaway climate change. A communique released by the AP6 states: \"We recognise that fossil fuels underpin our economies, and will be an enduring reality for our lifetimes and beyond\" - the document said. Green groups say the pact has missed a vital opportunity to commit to renewable energy sources. They say the two-day meeting failed to make any serious commitments in combatting global warming. Combined, the United States, China, Japan, India, South Korea and Australia, account for around half the globe's greenhouse gases. The six countries set up the summit as an ulterior method of tackling global warming outside the Kyoto Protocol by, they say, focussing on \"clean-energy technology.\" Nuclear Power, clean coal technologies, geosequestration and industry-driven environment funds were some of the proposals raised at the summit. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol the six nations have not set any targets to cut greenhouse gases. Climate change observers have broadly criticised the AP6 as a waste of time. Australian Climate Institute's Clive Hamilton says the meeting did little to cut greenhouse gas emissions. \"I think really this conference is about trying to protect the long-term future of the coal industry,\" he said. \"If you look at the sort of business people who have a seat at the table at the conference in Sydney, they overwhelmingly represent the polluting industries rather than those that will at some time in the future replace them - the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries.\" CSIRO chief scientist Dr David Brockway says the technology required to reduce greenhouse emissions is not viable for industry. \"It has to be borne in mind that anything we are going to do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and intensity from the Australian economy will come at a cost,\" he said. \"What we are doing at the moment is doing research to try and reduce the size of that additional cost. I would say in a five to 10 year timeframe a number of these technologies will become viable.\" An AP6 communique issued at the end of the conference said reductions in greenhouse gases must be achieved without hindering economic growth - \"the partnership aims to mobilise domestic and foreign investment into clean and low-emission technology by fostering the best possible enabling environments,\" it states. Some of the world's big mining and energy firms attended the talks and pledged to improve efficiency. Green groups, who were left out of the conference, say the talks were aimed at subverting Kyoto - which obligates some 40 developed countries to cut greenhouse emissions by 5 percent below 1990 levels during 2008-2012. \"Basically, they haven't agreed to do anything in terms of serious commitment,\" said Monash University climate change expert Professor Amanda Lynch. The United States and Australia refuse to sign Kyoto claiming its mandatory greenhouse gas cuts would threaten economic growth. Australian Prime Minister John Howard said, \"experience has taught us that seeking arbitrary targets doesn't result in achieving practical solutions to global climate change.\" Mr Howard stressed the importance of maintaining economic growth to alleviate poverty, while cutting greenhouse emissions. He said the summit had injected \"an overdue dose of realism into the debate about climate change. We believe it is possible to tackle issues of greenhouse gas emissions and the challenge of climate change without reducing living standards,\" he said. \"The world will go on using fossil fuels for many years into the future because it's more economic to do so. So therefore it's elementary commonsense that you should try and make the use of fossil fuels more greenhouse gas sensitive, you should try and clean up the use of fossil fuel,\" he said. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) have dismissed Mr Howard's comments as misleading and irresponsible. The WWF's chief executive Greg Bourne said, \"in my whole business career, I have never seen a more misleading public statement as that... If the statements made today become a reality, this will lock us in to a four-degree rise in global average temperatures, when two-degrees is considered extremely dangerous,\" he said. \"There couldn't be anything more irresponsible than to knowingly embark on a path towards massive increases in emissions and runaway global warming.\" The AP6 nations said in the final communique that the eight public/private partnership taskforces created at the conference, will draw up action plans by the middle of 2006 on issues including renewable energy, power generation, cleaner fossil fuels and coal mining. Environmentalists said the Sydney pact was doomed to fail because it did not impose targets on its members which comprise nearly half of humanity. The New South Wales Nature Conservation Council said the group's voluntary approach was a \"licence for government and business to do nothing\". \"Without any incentives or penalties there is no reason for industry to move away from burning polluting coal and oil,\" said the council's Cate Faehrmann. The AP6 countries encompass: 49 per cent of world GDP; 48 per cent of the world energy consumption; 48 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions; and 45 per cent of the world's population.

The verdict virtually put Andersen, once one of the largest accounting firms in the world and the fifth-largest in the United States, out of business. In a unanimous opinion written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the court threw out the verdict due to serious flaws in the jury instructions.  The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld Andersen's June 15, 2002 conviction in Houston. In the court's view, the instructions allowed the jury to convict Andersen without proving that the firm knew it broke the law or that there was a link to any official proceeding that prohibited the destruction of documents.  \"The jury instructions at issue simply failed to convey the requisite consciousness of wrongdoing,\" Rehnquist wrote. \"Indeed, it is striking how little culpability the instructions required.\"  Rehnquist's opinion also expressed grave skepticism at the government's definition of \"corrupt persuasion\" \u2014 persuasion with an improper purpose even without knowing an act is unlawful.  \"Only persons conscious of wrongdoing can be said to 'knowingly corruptly persuade,' \" he wrote. The ruling came very quickly, as oral arguments in the case had taken place on April 27. Justice Department attorneys claimed Andersen employees were instructed \"undertake an unprecedented campaign of document destruction\" in order to impede a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into Enron's conduct.  Deputy Solicitor General David Dreeben likened Andersen's behavior to \"shredding its smoking guns.\" However, Maureen Mahoney, arguing for Andersen, countered that the employees involved merely followed the company's policy on destroying unneeded documents, and that the shredding occurred before Andersen received a subpoena on November 8, 2001.  She also claimed that under the government's legal definition of \"corrupt persuasion,\" acquittal was virtually impossible. The justices seemed to indicate which way they were leaning very early in oral arguments, as they peppered the government lawyers with hostile remarks. Justice Antonin Scalia called the government's theory of prosecution \"weird.\"  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was particularly troubled by the trouble the jury initially had sifting the evidence.  \"If this thing is so confusing,\" she asked, \"how is a businessperson supposed to know?  How is a lawyer supposed to know?\" Andersen's appeal was backed by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.  In a friend-of-the-court brief, the association claimed that the government's broad definition of \"corrupt persuasion\" put defense lawyers at risk for prosecution simply for advising clients of their rights to assert legal privileges or review document retention policies. Despite the ruling, which returns the case to the Fifth Circuit, it is highly unlikely Andersen will ever return as a viable business.  It lost nearly all of its clients after its indictment, and was forced to shut down its American accounting practice due to federal laws that forbid convicted felons from auditing public companies.  The firm still faces more than 100 civil suits related to its audits of Enron and other companies.  Once 28,000 employees strong, the Chicago-based Andersen is now down to around 200 employees who are largely occupied with handling the civil suits and other details of winding down the partnership."}, "5-19": {"heading": "Global warming underestimated, say scientists ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Global_warming_underestimated,_say_scientists", "date": "23-May-2006", "text": "Some scientists say current climate change estimates may be significantly underestimating the potential scale of global warming. The team of researchers report that the actual warming due to human fossil fuel emissions could be 15 percent to 78 percent higher than estimates that fail to take into account the feedback mechanism which involves carbon dioxide and Earth temperature. Greenhouse gases are believed to contribute to global warming, yet scientists have said that global warming itself triggers greenhouse gas emissions - meaning that the Earth may get hotter faster than climate models predict. Another team of researchers in California, has reported a similar conclusion: \"when the Earth has warmed up in the past, due to the sun's natural cycles, more greenhouse gases have been spewed into the atmosphere. As greenhouse gas levels rose, so did the Earth's temperature,\" the scientists reported. Dr Margaret Torn of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory said: \"It means the warming is happening faster, each decade is actually warming faster than it would have,\" Dr Torn said. \"It's the pace of change that will be one of the big problems. It's how humans adapt and the cost that will depend on the rate of change of climate.\" Over the past 30 years, the Earth has warmed by 0.6 degrees Celsius, NASA has reported. Over the past 100 years, it has warmed by 0.8 degrees C, indicating a recent acceleration in warmth. Current climate models predict temperature increases of 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius, but the California team realised that additional carbon dioxide caused by the natural solar cycle may elevate these estimates. Taking this information on board could mean temperature increases of 1.6 to 6 degrees Celsius - and the higher temperatures are more likely, they said in a statement. Meanwhile, another group of leading US scientists has linked global warming to the recent increase in hurricane intensity. They warn that humans must develop cleaner energy and transportation immediately - or bear the risk of more extreme storms. \"One is faced with repeating history, of putting up with $200 billion worth of damage every so often,\" said Dr. Peter Webster, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology and author of a 2005 study that found the strength and duration of hurricanes has doubled in the last 50 years. \"I\u2019m not sure how many $200 billion the country can afford,\" he told journalists. Lawrence Berkeley's Dr Torn said humans are the biggest unknown: \"To predict the future, you have to guess how much CO2 levels will go up. That depends on the biggest uncertainty of all - what humans decide to do. Do we get smart and prevent CO2 emissions? Do we continue with business as usual?

He said that he had mentioned the preceding point of view in the presence of an under-secretary of the US government at a business breakfast this morning. He answered to a later question that he felt disappointed at the current stance of the US government, and wished clarity for the moment. According to a press release by Greenpeace, the German environmental minister Sigmar Gabriel also declared to the press that the EU would not be taking part in the scheduled MEM in January if substantial progress was not made. Amongst other points that are currently being discussed, one which is often referred to is that of whether or not a guideline frame for emissions reductions is to be included in the preamble of one of the final documents. The proposed frame is 25-40% cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized nations (known as Annex I nations in UNFCCC parlance), from 1990 baselines. The US is amongst the relatively small number of nations, including Canada and Japan, that are opposed to this. Asked what he knew of the matter at an earlier press conference, Yvo de Boer of the UNFCCC stated that Stavros Dimas, the European Commissioner for the Environment, had voiced his opinion that if no agreement is reached now, than there would be no need for the Major Emitting nations meeting to be held, because, so he apparently stated, the MEM is meant to feed into the UN process, and you could not feed something into nothing. The talks being held in Bali are expected to lead to a roadmap for negotiations on greenhouse gas emissions caps for after 2012, which is when the current first phase of the Kyoto protocol is going to run out. Multiple parties, observers, and the top UN executive of the Climate Change branch all had expressed their hope that this roadmap would also include a target date of 2009 for the conclusion of negotiations.

The largest climate conference in history at the Bella Center in Copenhagen, Denmark is running for two-weeks from December 7 until December 18. Around 15,000 delegates including representatives from the private sector, environmental organizations, research institutions and government officials, as well as 110 heads of state and government from 192 countries, will attend. The COP15 Cultural Opening Ceremony played a four-minute long film called Please help the world by the Danish director Mikkel Blaabjerg Poulsen to highlight the danger of rising temperatures. The film depicts a young girl\u2019s screaming nightmare about an eco-apocalypse with global warming, desert wastelands and terrifying floods. As the girl wakes from the nightmare she and other children implores us to 'Please help the world'. Poulsen said, \u201cWe have made a film which speaks to the heart rather than to the brain\u201d. There was also music from a trumpeter, a harpist and the Danish National Girls Choir. The UN climate change conference, the climax of two years of contentious negotiations, opened in an atmosphere of hope. There was an upbeat mood for a deal to be reached within the next two weeks.  At a press briefing,  Connie Hedegaard, the president of the conference, said that \u201cthe deadline is working\u201d, but \u201cwithin the time we have, we must solve the task\u201d. Lars Lokke Rasmussen stressed, however, that the talks will have to overcome the deep distrust between rich and poor nations on how to share the burden of curbing emissions. There has been a series of promises by rich and emerging economies to curb their greenhouse gases, but there are major issues yet to be resolved.  UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that a legally binding treaty on climate change will be reached in 2010. The European Union has adopted a commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels but the union will raise its commitments to 30% if other major players undertake \u201ccomparable commitments\u201d.

Quoting an unnamed diplomatic source, the Financial Times Deutschland has said the EU is to provide \u201c1-3 billion euro\u201d in aid to developing countries over the next three years so they can fight the effects of climate change and allow climate change mitigation and adaptation. The conference was accused of environmental hypocrisy for its substantial carbon footprint, including its extensive use of private jets and limousines. To reduce the conference's environmental and climate impact, the Danish government will not give gifts to participants.

He stressed that, as this was a problem created by all nations, effecting all, it had to be tackled within the UN-framework, and that agreements made by only a number of states would fall short of what is needed.

After the activists attempted to enter the nearby convention centre where the premier was speaking, staff working with the Premier agreed to accept the petitions. \"Translink is currently exhausting its capital reserves just to keep existing service going,\" said Karen Wristen, Executive Director of SPEC. \"At this rate, they will be broke in two years. We simply can't afford both freeway expansion and transit development: we have to solve the transit crisis first.\" \"It will be virtually impossible to reach BC's commitments to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) if Gateway is allowed to proceed. Gateway is not just an irresponsible plan, it's immoral,\" said Ben West, the Wilderness Committee's Healthy Communities Campaigner. The government calculates that greenhouse gas emissions will increase by over 170,000 tonnes per year from the Gateway program. Premier Gordon Campbell has not yet responded directly to the petition. In recent interviews he has defended the Gateway Program. \"I understand that some people will disagree with it,\" Premier Campbell said of Gateway on April 6 to The Georgia Straight. \"But it's many, many things that are happening at once to make the region more livable, to reduce our impact and our greenhouse-gas impact, and to invest in public transit. And I think that when you take all those things together\u2014as we move to California tailpipe emissions and those other initiatives\u2014I think you will see actually a reduction in greenhouse gases.\" This article is based on 10,000 people (and two polar bears) Petition Premier by B5baxter  which has a copyright policy compatible with our CC-BY 2.5.

Temperatures so far this year have averaged one degree above the 30-year average, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) told the Greenhouse 2005 \u2013 Action in Climate Change Conference being held in Melbourne this week. The head of the National Climate Centre, Michael Coughlan, says Australia has had the warmest ever first 10 months of 2005, and seems likely to be a record-breaking year. \"It's typically been a degree or more above the average for most of the months,\" said Mr Coughlan. \"When you think you're averaging over hundreds of stations across Australia, to get a one degree warming over such a large area is fairly significant.\" According to BOM, Australia has experienced its warmest start to a year on record (since 1950), with the January to October temperature averaging 1.03 degrees Celsius above the 30 year average (1961-1990). Annual mean temperatures have increased throughout Australia since 1910, particularly since the 1950s. \"If one draws a trend line from the mid-50s or early 50s, through to the present, it's a fairly steady upward trend. And it's interesting that this is not true only of Australia, but it's fairly typical throughout most continents now, most parts of the world,\" said Mr Coughlan. As the average temperature has risen, there has been an increase in the incidence of hot days and hot nights, and a reduction in the number of cold days and nights. This warming is mirrored in the oceans around Australia. Michael Coughlan says warm sea surfaces are a significant factor in the creation of cyclones and hurricanes. \"One might expect, with those sea temperatures being warmer than they have been in the last few years, that the odds would be tipped towards perhaps a greater number of the cyclones than we have seen in the last few years,\" he says. Warming is not the only sign of change in Australia\u2019s climate. Other changes include a marked decline in rainfall in southwest and parts of southeast Australia, and recent reduction in rainfall through the eastern states. At the same time, rainfall in the arid interior and northwest has increased dramatically, in some places nearly doubling during the last 50-years. \"Climate change affecting Australia is real,\" says CSIRO's Dr Bryson Bates. \"In 2005 the questions we face are how best to respond and adapt \u2013 from projections in agriculture to changing ecosystems, reduced catchment flows and downward rainfall trends,\" Dr Bates says. The GREENHOUSE 2005 Action on Climate Change Conference is expected to attract 400 Australian and international delegates."}, "5-31": {"heading": "Wikinews' overview of the year 2007 ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wikinews%27_overview_of_the_year_2007", "date": "31-December-2007", "text": "What would you tell your grandchildren about 2007 if they asked you about it in, let's say, 20 year's time? If the answer to a quiz question was 2007, what would the question be? The year that you first signed on to Facebook? The year Britney Spears and Amy Winehouse fell apart? The year author Kurt Vonnegut or mime Marcel Marceau died, both at 84? Let's take a look at some of the international stories of 2007. Links to the original Wikinews articles are in bold. Madeleine McCann (3) disappeared on May 3 in Praia da Luz, Portugal. Initially, a local man called Robert Murat was mentioned as a suspect, although on August 7,  Kate and Gerry McCann became suspects based on forensic evidence. On April 16, 33 dead, 15 injured in Virginia Tech shootings: A single gunman entered the campus and opened fire on students and faculty in two separate incidents, first in the West Ambler Johnston Hall dormitory, then again two hours later at the Norris Hall classroom building, killing 33 people, including himself. It became the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history. The shooter was identified as Cho Seung-Hui, a 23-year old South Korean national. He was studying English and lived on the university campus. Between the two shootings, Cho sent a mail package to NBC News with his manifesto, pictures and videos. In early September, adventurer Steve Fossett went missing. Fossett reportedly took off in a single engine plane to look for a suitable site in the Nevada playas for his planned land speed record attempt. His former crewmate and rival, Sir Richard Branson remained confident he would be found: \"Steve is a tough old boot. I suspect he is waiting by his plane right now for someone to pick him up.\" On October 12, The 2007 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The Nobel committee cited \"for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change\" as the reasons for awarding the prize. In late October, 1,000,000 fled their homes in California due to wildfires strengthened by the Santa Ana Winds. A state of emergency was declared by President Bush and California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. At a last-minute FEMA press conference with regards to the wildfires, FEMA employees posed as reporters asking what were regarded as overly friendly questions. Many banks in the USA saw their share prices falling after people were found to be unable to pay back many of their mortgages. The mortgages lent to people who may not be able to afford to pay back their loans are known as subprime mortgages. This spread across the stock markets internationally and UK bank Northern Rock had thousands of people queuing outside their bank after they borrowed money from the Bank of England, which is known as \"the lender of last resort.\" On January 10, 21,500 more troops to bring Operation Law and Order to Baghdad was made public. The U.S. forces began to collaborate more intensely with Iraqi troops. On February 21, the UK and Denmark announced troop withdrawals from Iraq. \"The next chapter in Basra\u2019s history can be written by Iraqis,\" said Tony Blair. Following a reduction in violence and troop deaths in the second half of 2007, the U.S. announced troop reductions in November. Meanwhile, Turkey said it would use military action against PKK rebels attacking the country from neighboring Iraq, which the U.S. pledged support for and \"hoped to avoid\". (Image missing from Commons: image; log)]] Vladimir Putin was named \"man of the year\" by Time Magazine. He would finish his 2nd and last term as President in 2008, although he said he would accept to subsequently become Prime Minister. Under Putin, Russia strove to increase its position as a geopolitical superpower, for example by claiming the North Pole. During 2007 former chess grandmaster Gary Kasparov, now a political activist, drew the attention of the international media. Boris Yeltsin, former president of Russia, died at 76 on April 23. Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin (Russian: \u0411\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0301\u0441 \u041d\u0438\u043a\u043e\u043b\u0430\u0301\u0435\u0432\u0438\u0447 \u0415\u0301\u043b\u044c\u0446\u0438\u043d) was the first President of the Russian Federation from 1991 to 1999. The Yeltsin era was a traumatic period in Russian history\u2014 marked by widespread corruption, economic collapse, and enormous political and social problems. Yeltsin maintained a low profile since his resignation, making almost no public statements or appearances. However, on February 1, 2006, Yeltsin celebrated his 75th birthday. He used this occasion as an opportunity to criticize a \"monopolistic\" United States foreign policy, and to state that Vladimir Putin was the right choice for Russia. More British troops were sent into Afghanistan, where the war that started after the 9/11 attacks continued with a large number of news events. In late August, it was reported that opium production in Afghanistan reached record highs. Australian David Hicks would become the first Guant\u00e1namo Bay prisoner to be sentenced, after which he returned to an Australian prison to serve out his time and was released on December 29. May 6: Sarkozy wins 2007 French Presidential election, defeating S\u00e9gol\u00e8ne Royal. Both separated from their partners afterwards. Sarko's style and self proclaimed openness is proved different from his predecessor Jacques Chirac. His confrontation with the unions came in the second half of November. On October 30, the French NGO Zoe's Ark was accused of trying to kidnap hundreds of Chadian children they described as Darfur orphans -Sarkozy travelled to Chad to hold talks with local officials. After a previous attack in October and house arrest, former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was killed in a suicide attack on 27th December, when an attacker fired 2 gun shots at her then exploded a bomb. This assassination occurred just weeks after Musharraf lifted the state of emergency that he had instated in November in his country. Her son and husband assumed her place at the top of the Pakistan People's Party. In March, Musharraf sacked Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, but he was reinstated in July. On March 23, Iran captured 15 members of the British Navy and held them for alleged espionage. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad pardoned them after 12 days, saying: While the President of Iran was in New York City for the United Nations General Assembly in September, he was invited to a controversial debate at Columbia University. When challenged by the University President about Iran's treatment of LGBT's, Ahmadinejad stated that: \"In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country,\" drawing laughter from the audience. \"In Iran we do not have this phenomenon, I don't know who has told you that we have it.\" On January 19, Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink was assassinated in front of the Agos newspaper office where he worked as the editor. Dink was known for writing about the controversial issue of Armenian genocide and the mass killings of Armenians by Turks under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. His assassin was then treated by some Turkish security troops as a \"national hero\". In April and May, several large protests were held across the country by pro-secular Turks, out of fear that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan would run for President, then due to concerns about Presidential Candidate Abdullah G\u00fcl, whose wife wears the islamic headscarf. G\u00fcl was not appointed in the first parliamentary round, when opposition lawmakers boycotted the vote. The opposition also appealed to the Constitutional Court to declare the process unlawful. General elections followed and G\u00fcl became President on August 28. In Myanmar (formerly Burma) government forces arrested hundreds of monks in September after several days of peaceful demonstrations, but despite the violent treatment from military personnel, the monks returned to the streets. Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, had called \"the continued detention of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and over one thousand political prisoners\" unacceptable. Pro-democracy leaders were arrested and a death toll of more than 1000 was reported. In late October, Myanmar opposition leader and 1991 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi left her house arrest to meet with government official. On June 24 this year Gordon Brown took over from Tony Blair as leader of the UK labour party and therefore Prime Minister after a long period of time where reporters were predicting the date of Blair's departure. After this the UK was hit by its worst floods in 50 years. In late November, two computer disks were lost containing the entire Child Benefit database, estimated to contain the names, addresses, dates of birth, child benefit and National Insurance numbers, and sometimes the bank or building society account details of 25 million individuals, in what has been described as \"one of the world\u2019s biggest ID protection failures\". Ian \"Dr. No\" Paisley and former IRA commander Martin McGuinness agreed to share power and have home rule return to Northern Ireland after four years of central rule from London. \"I believe we're starting on a road which will bring us back to peace and to prosperity,\" said Paisley, who took the post of First Minister of Northern Ireland. Just one day after a car bomb was defused in central London on June 29, a Jeep was driven into the Glasgow International Airport terminal and burst into flames in an unsuccessful terrorist attack. Several people aided the police in detaining the assailants, including baggage handler John Smeaton who received the Queen's Gallantry Medal for his actions. On December 3, Kevin Rudd was sworn in as Prime Minister of Australia after John Howard and the Liberal Party and Coalition were defeated in the election. After the ceremony, Mr. Rudd signed documents to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate change calling it the first official act of the new Australian government. A post-Kyoto agreement on climate change and combating poverty in Africa were the main topics at the summit of the 7 richest industrialised countries and Russia in Heiligendamm in June. While France and Germany were calling for quantifiable greenhouse gas emission cuts, the U.S. and Japan believed that growing economies such as India and China would need to join in on such efforts. Advocacy groups were critical about the aid promised to Africa: \"Do they think we can\u2019t read or count?\" asked musician/activist Bono. \"We are looking for accountable language and accountable numbers: we didn\u2019t get them today.\" The G8 Summit was preceded by mass demonstrations, such as the one in Rostock, where several hundred protesters were arrested. Eight people were killed in a school shooting in Jokela, Finland. The shooter, an 18-year-old male student named as Pekka-Eric Auvinen, was arrested after a siege situation, but died due to a gunshot wound from an apparent suicide attempt. The killer had uploaded a home-made movie to YouTube announcing the \"massacre\" one day prior to the shooting. His profile featured several movies regarding an ongoing depression and unsuccessful treatment with SSRIs. Additionally, some movies of him shooting his new gun had been uploaded weeks prior to the shooting. Auvinen also had a personal website which featured images, music and documents, including a manifesto. After the incident, Finland considered toughening gun legislation. Until then, Finland had actively resisted plans for all European Union member states to limit gun ownership to persons aged 18 and over. The law stipulated that Finns could apply for a gun permit at the age of 15. Cristina Kirchner was the favourite candidate to succeed her husband as President. N\u00e9stor Kirchner decided not to run for a second four-year term, without giving an explanation. Mrs Kirchner consistently used her first name during her electoral campaign, which is a similarity to United States presidential candidate Hilary Clinton. However Cristina told the media: \"I don't want to be compared with Hillary Clinton or with Evita Per\u00f3n, or with anybody... There's nothing better than being yourself.\" The two-week long U.N. climate conference in Bali ended with an agreement on the so-called Bali roadmap, which was welcomed with cautious optimism. The roadmap details the process for a post-2012 climate change agreement. European Union Commission President Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso stated: \"We have worked hard to achieve this result. It is a very important step forward.\" The European Commissioner for Environment made it clear that Bali had only been the start of things: \"Now the real hard work must begin. It is essential that the agreement to be worked out over the next two years is ambitious enough to prevent global warming from reaching dangerous levels.\u201d More than half of the year in Belgium focused on politics, as the general elections on June 10 promised some difficult coalition talks. PM Verhofstadt recognised his defeat by Christian-Democrat Yves Leterme of Flanders, while the liberals broke the socialist hegemony in Wallonia. Orange-blue coalition talks failed to produce a government for 192 days, when it was Verhofstadt who gathered consensus for an interim government. Earlier in the year, Belgium's first black city registrar organised a mass wedding against racism that caught international media attention. The RCMP, received a negative spotlight in 2007, particularly for their handling of a distraught passenger at Vancouver International Airport in November. Robert Dziekanski, 40, was immigrating from Pieszyce, Poland to live with his mother, Zofia Cisowski, in Kamloops, British Columbia. Since Dziekanski did not speak English airport security guards were unable to properly communicate with him. He started yelling at the airport staff because of this. He used chairs to prop open a door between a customs clearing area and a public lounge, he then threw a computer and threw a small table at a luggage section window. The police tasered him twice and he died. Following the shooting deaths, in separate incidents, of two mounties stationed in northern communities, there were calls for policy changes related to how and when individual officers should call for back-up. One of the world's best-regarded tenor singers, Luciano Pavarotti, died 6th September. His funeral drew thousands including Bono of U2, and fellow tenors Pl\u00e1cido Domingo and Jos\u00e9 Carreras. Pavarotti succumbed to pancreatic cancer which was diagnosed in July 2006. In January, Apple announced its iPhone, which hit U.S. markets on July and made customers queue in the U.K. in November. Apple's decision to lock the phone to use one network exclusively was criticized as \"anti-competitive\", and hackers started circumnavigating the restrictions imposed on the phone. On January 1, 2007, Slovenia adopted the euro currency, and Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union. In December, E.U. leaders signed the Treaty of Lisbon, a landmark document which is to redefine foreign policy for the E.U. and creates an E.U. president. The treaty is a replacement for the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe which was abandoned after suffering defeats in referendums in France and the Netherlands. United Kingdom Prime Minister Gordon Brown arrived late and added his signature later. Following alleged espionage, McLaren  (the team of Fernando Alonso and newcomer Lewis Hamilton) was initially cleared but then in September fined $100 million and excluded from the Constructor's championship. The highly controversial and enthralling 2007 season came to an when Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen won the 2007 Championship."}, "5-32": {"heading": "Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, releases study of local emissions ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Cambridge,_Massachusetts,_USA,_releases_study_of_local_emissions", "date": "16-April-2005", "text": "According to the Cambridge Chronicle, a report issued by the city of Cambridge on the topic of greenhouse gas emissions claimed that despite a two-year old pledge to reduce harmful emissions, the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere in the city has increased. Since 1990, carbon dioxide emissions have increased by 27% in the city, mostly due to industrial processes, says the paper. In 1999, the city joined Cities for Climate Protection, a coalition of towns in Massachusetts interested in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. In 2002, the city released a study, the Cambridge Climate Protection Plan, which set emission reduction goals for the city. The plan proposed that \"we reduce GHG emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels. This means the community needs to reduce and prevent annual GHG emissions of 494,400 tons of carbon dioxide.\" While the city has failed thus far to reduce its emissions, it has been experimenting with alternative transportation technology in its vehicles. According to the city's website, Cambridge currently owns and operates 20 electric vehicles and 1 compressed natural gas truck.

The report also noted most Australians believed improving the global environment should be Australia's number one foreign policy goal. Mark Wakeham of Greenpeace said, \"Clearly Australians understand the warnings from scientists about greenhouse pollution far better than our governments do. Once again, the community is leading and governments will be pulled into line.\" He continued by saying, \"Scientists tell us that, to avoid dangerous warming of more than two degrees, we have to cut our greenhouse pollution by at least 60 per cent by 2050.

The researchers conducted a comparison of the environmental impact of electric cars in view of different ratios of green-to-fuel electricity energy sources.  In the case of mostly coal- or oil-based electricity supply, electric cars are disadvantageous compared to classic diesel cars with the greenhouse effect impact being up to two times larger. The researchers found that in Europe, electric cars pose a \"10% to 24% decrease in global warming potential (GWP) relative to conventional diesel or gasoline vehicles\".

In the summit's conclusions, the E.U. underlines its ambitions as a leading force in international climate protection. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the targets \"ambitious and credible\". Europe is prepared to even increase the objectives if other developed countries follow suit, and it invites other countries to come forward with their plans for the environment beyond 2012, when the Kyoto protocol ends. In June, Merkel plans to discuss the measures with the other members on the Group of Eight summit. The proposal takes into account the sovereignty of individual countries to determine exactly which energy sources they use. More specifically, each member state should decide if they wish to use nuclear power or not. Some countries oppose the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels, and Germany is even in the process of dismantling its nuclear energy production. France on the other hand produces 70% of its electricity in nuclear power plants.

Other criticisms of the protocol are that the treaty does not include India and China, or other developing nations.

According to CSIRO research scientist Dr Mike Raupach, 7.9 billion tonnes of carbon were emitted into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide in 2005 -  a doubling in the rate of increase since 1990 - and the rate of increase continues to accelerate. Data from the Cape Grim air pollution monitoring station in north-west Tasmania shows carbon dioxide emissions have increased by 2.5% each year for the past five years. \"From 2000 to 2005, the growth rate of carbon dioxide emissions was more than 2.5% per year, whereas in the 1990s it was less than 1% per year,\" Dr Raupach says. Dr Raupach, who co-chairs the international Global Carbon Project also, was surprised by his research results. \"It shows recent efforts globally to reduce emissions have had little impact on emissions growth,\" he said. The CSIRO found that in global terms, China has the highest current growth rate in CO2 emissions although it's emissions per person are below the global average. China's accumulated contribution since the start the 1800s is only five per cent of the global total. The USA and Europe have each contributed more than 25% of accumulated global emissions. Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere \u2014 a separate measure to carbon emissions \u2014 had also increased at an unprecedented rate. Dr Paul Fraser, also from CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research, said that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide grew by two parts per million in 2005, the fourth year in a row of above-average growth. \"To have four years in a row of above-average carbon dioxide growth is unprecedented,\" Dr Fraser said. He said the trend over recent years suggests the growth rate is accelerating, \"signifying that fossil fuels are having an impact on greenhouse gas concentrations in a way we haven\u2019t seen in the past.\""}, "5-43": {"heading": "Conservatives plan to reject budget over newly introduced Kyoto amendment in Canada ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Conservatives_plan_to_reject_budget_over_newly_introduced_Kyoto_amendment_in_Canada", "date": "26-March-2005", "text": "The Canadian Conservative Party plans to reject the federal budget.

He says its effect in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is also negligible. \"Nuclear power can only solve a very tiny portion of greenhouse gas problems because electricity is only one source of the problem,\" said Mr Shallhorn. \"Nuclear power is not going to solve emissions from aircraft, from the industrial sector or from industrial processes.\" \"I think it is inevitable.

The planet, Gliese 581d orbits the same star as Gliese 581c but at a distance of 23 million miles.

Mr Downer's comments follow similar comments made by Australian Prime Minister John Howard in Canada last week. Mr Downer said that climate change has strongly influenced many to change their position on nuclear power and to encourage debate. He encouraged people to keep an open mind on nuclear power within the context of reducing greenhouse gases. The production of nuclear energy produces far fewer greenhouse gas emissions than coal and oil power stations. Mr Downer also said that it would make sense for Australia to investigate nuclear power generation given that it has 30 to 40 percent of the world's Uranium reserves. Mr Downer said any discussion would need to look at whether Australia would build nuclear power stations in the future and whether a Uranium enrichment program would be undertaken. \"There's the question of whether Australia itself would eventually, some time, no doubt in the far distant future, build nuclear power stations,\" he said. \"There's a question of whether Australia would ever enrich uranium - in other words, we go up the processing chain, rather than just dig it out.\" Mr Downer said. Unlike Australian industry minister, Ian MacFarlane and finance minister, Nick Minchin, Mr Downer refused to say when he thought nuclear energy would become a reality in Australia. Mr Downer said the construction of nuclear power plants would depend on two things - political debate and economic considerations.

The announcement of the listing was made by Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne. In making the announcement, Kempthorne said he wishes to prevent further losses of polar bears, but he warned against using the Endangered Species Act to \"regulate greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles, power plants, and other sources\", which he called \"a wholly inappropriate use of the ESA law.\" Kempthorne says the Interior Department will apply separate rules from the Marine Mammal Protection Act to the polar bear, which will permit flexibility in economic development as long as the survival of the species is not adversely affected. Kempthorne said the policies \"will ensure the protection of the bear while allowing us to continue to develop our natural resources in the Arctic region in an environmentally sound way.\" The Government of Nunavut fears the decision could lead to a ban on the importation of polar bear hides into the United States. As a result the Nunavut economy could suffer. The polar bear hunt generates $1.5 million (US) per year in revenue. Carl Pope, director of the environmentalist Sierra Club, criticized the Interior Department's decision, saying it was \"riddled with loopholes, caveats and backhanded language that could actually undermine protections for the polar bear and other species\". The government was forced to make a decision regarding the polar bear by May 15, after environmental groups sued the George W. Bush administration for failing to meet a January 9 deadline. The administration was accused of postponing the decision as a way to allow for more Alaskan oil and gas drilling. The purpose of the Endangered Species Act is to protect species that may be in danger of extinction as a result of human action. It aims to achieve this by regulating federal activity in the habitat of threatened species. Commercial activity is not directly regulated, but companies must receive a permit for development in designated habitats. The polar bear is the first animal to be protected under the Endangered Species Act due to the threat that global warming poses to the bears' Arctic habitat. Some environmental groups say they could use the designation to protest the construction of coal power plants located thousands of miles away from the Arctic, which they blame for contributing to greenhouse gases and global warming. However, Barton H. Thompson Jr., a law professor at Stanford University, says that such lawsuits would be difficult to win. \"Interior has a reasonable case here that the connection [between greenhouse gas emmissions and polar bears] is just too far removed,\" he says. If sea ice continues to melt, two-thirds of the polar bear population could be gone by 2050, according to studies released by the United States Geological Survey last September. Also, Louis Fortier of the Canadian research group ArcticNet believes the Arctic Ocean could be ice-free in the summers by 2010. But M. Reed Hopper of the Pacific Legal Foundation, a property-rights group, disputes the notion that the polar bear is severely threatened.

He told the Senate estimates that the committee would effectively try to develop an Australian perspective on the American proposal.

The enrichment process is energy-intensive and Australia is already the world's highest per capita greenhouse gas emitter. We cannot afford another energy guzzling industry, especially when this government has abandoned renewable energy,\" she said. \"Enriching uranium concentrates the isotopes making the uranium more hazardous, more polluting, and makes Australia a greater target for nuclear terrorism.\" Senator Milne said on the Democrats website: \"Australians want leadership on this issue, not knee jerk reactions to what George Bush thinks is a good idea. They want a debate that isn't set up to merely justify selling enriched uranium and nuclear power.\" Anthony Albanese says John Howard's push for a nuclear energy debate would become \"Australia's nightmare.\" Mr Albanese said Mr Howard's views were retrospective and not in Australia's best interests: \"This is classic John Howard whether it be the GST, whether it be the extreme industrial relations agenda, or whether it be this nuclear fantasy which will become Australia's nightmare \u2013 John Howard always returns to the past,\" Mr Albanese said in a News Limited article. \"For John Howard to say that there hasn't been a debate on nuclear energy would suggest that he went to sleep in the 50s and he's just woken up.\" Mr Albanese said the dangers and costs of nuclear energy outweighed the energy benefits. \"The problems of cost, safety, waste disposals and nuclear proliferation in the climate of terrorism are more acute today than they've ever been.\" Meanwhile a new study by the Australia Institute has identified several areas on Australia's east coast, where nuclear power plants could be built if the Howard Government decide to take the nuclear energy path. The Australia Institute say they have consulted experts who say that the plant will need to be located on the coast, near transmission lines and be near a major centre with good rail and port access.

Professor David Keith, Director of University of Calgary's (UofC) Institute for Sustainable Energy, Environment and Economy (ISEEE) and a team of researchers from UofC's Energy and Environmental Systems Group built and operated a prototype system this summer producing results that compared favourably with commercial carbon capture systems. Two 'provisional' patents have been filed on the technology but Keith warns there are still \"many pitfalls along the path to commercialization.\" Using a process adapted from the pulp-and-paper industry that halves the cost of CO2 air capture in their custom-built tower, Professor Keith and his team captured the equivalent of about 20 tonnes per year of CO2 (approximately equal to the yearly output of one person in North America) directly from the air with less than 100 kilowatt-hours of electricity per tonne of carbon dioxide on a single square metre of scrubbing material. \"This means that if you used electricity from a coal-fired power plant, for every unit of electricity you used to operate the capture machine, you'd be capturing 10 times as much CO2 as the power plant emitted making that much electricity,\" explains Professor Keith. A report co-authored by Keith in the American Chemical Society's journal Environmental Science & Technology  explains \"nearly all current research on carbon capture and storage (CCS) focuses on capturing CO2 from large, stationary sources such as power plants.

The Bali meeting aims to get countries to commit to working out a new agreement on emissions cuts to extend or replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012. Conference president Rachmat Witoelar of Indonesia told reporters that a detailed proposal is not necessary at this stage, but participation by all nations is vital. \"We will be happy if this Bali road map is general so we will not push for a very detailed in this short time,\" he said. \"The introduction, the process is important.\" As the conference opened, Australia's new prime minister, Kevin Rudd, signed the Kyoto Protocol, limiting his country's greenhouse gas emissions. That act earned a standing ovation in Bali, and focused attention on the failure of the United States to sign the protocol - the only developed nation not to have done so. \"While the current U.S. delegation will not join in serious negotiations over mandatory limits on global warming pollution, they won't be around when the final deal is made in 2009. A new team will be on the field with a very different game plan,\" he said. \"The other nations must not allow the U.S. to derail, delay or water down the Bali mandate.\" Senior U.S. negotiator Harlan Watson denied his country was blocking progress, saying the U.S. had merely chosen a different course. \"It's up to each country to do the analysis and analyze for themselves if the target is do-able. Obviously the U.S. came to a different conclusion,\" he said. \"We respect the decisions other countries have made and of course ask them to respect the decision that we've made.\" President Bush says that the Kyoto Protocol threatened U.S. economic growth, and believes that any future climate-change agreement will be ineffective unless it includes rapidly developing nations such as China and India, which are among the world's largest producers of greenhouse gases. Other subjects on the agenda in Bali include saving the world's remaining forests, and sharing technologies to help developing nations grow in less-polluting ways. The U.N. also hopes to finalize a fund to help countries affected by global warming to cope with the impacts. The money could go toward flood-proof houses, better water management, and crop diversification. The Bali conference will continue until December 14.

Climate models predicted more greenhouse gases would weaken the equatorial Pacific trade winds. While previous research supposed natural variability alone accounted for cooling in the eastern Pacific, this study highlights a previously overlooked climate feedback: as the Atlantic warms, it alters the winds over the Pacific, depressing the ocean temperature there. Coauthor Malte Stuecker of the University of Hawaii Meteorology Department reports that \"Our study documents that some of the largest tropical and subtropical climate trends of the past 20 years are all linked: Strengthening of the Pacific trade winds, acceleration of sea level rise [three times faster than the global average] in the western Pacific, eastern Pacific surface cooling, the global warming hiatus, and even the massive droughts in California\". His colleague cauthor Fei-Fei Jin adds, \"We are just starting to grasp the scope of the impacts of this global atmospheric reorganization and of the out-of phase temperature trends in the Atlantic and Pacific regions\". Coauthor Axel Timmermann of the University of Hawaii notes a further amplifying effect: \"Stronger trade winds in the equatorial Pacific also increase the upwelling of cold waters to the surface. The resulting near-surface cooling in the eastern Pacific amplifies the Atlantic\u2013Pacific pressure seesaw, thus further intensifying the trade winds [...] It turns out that the current generation of climate models underestimates the extent of the Atlantic\u2013Pacific coupling, which means that they cannot properly capture the observed eastern Pacific cooling, which has contributed significantly to the leveling off, or the hiatus, in global warming.\""}, "5-60": {"heading": "Thousands demand climate change action ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Thousands_demand_climate_change_action", "date": "3-December-2005", "text": "Thousands of people across Australia are taking part in protests calling on the Federal Government to ratify the Kyoto Protocol.

Siding with the United States, the Australian Federal Government has refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, arguing it is damaging to their economic interests. Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell says Australia is focused on measures that should be taken after Kyoto expires in 2012. \"We need to do something that suits the developed world, something that suits the rapidly developing world, partnerships, technologies, economic mechanisms that drive us towards that,\" said Campbell. \"We're nowhere near that at the moment and Australia wants to be a constructive part of driving us towards a very useful post-Kyoto regime.\" Protesters across Australia are using the International Day of Action on Climate Change to demand the government adopt a clean energy policy. Hundreds of people marched through Sydney on Saturday to mark the day. The protest against global warming coincides with the 12-day conference in Montreal, which will discuss climate change measures and future international action when the Kyoto Protocol expires at the end of 2012. Australia and the United States are the only western industrialised nations which refuse to ratify the global Kyoto Protocol. Australia has delegates at the Montreal meeting, but will only act as observers. Melinda Cook said scientists had predicted huge negative consequences including extreme weather and even social and economic impacts if steps were not taken now. Cook also said governments must make a \"serious commitment\" not to build any more coal fire powered stations. The United States Bush administration and the Australian Howard Government have refused to ratify the Kyoto agreement, which pledges industrialised nations to cut carbon dioxide levels to 5.2 per cent below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. Global Action Up to a million people will take to the streets of more than 100 cities across dozens of countries today to demand greater action on global warming. Organizers of the protests say the world's leading industrialised nations had failed to make an impact on climate change and some, in particular Britain, were backsliding on their environmental commitments. The United Nations meeting in Montreal, will be attended by representatives of 189 countries. The centerpiece of the International Day of Climate Protest will be a mass protest in Montreal, where at least 15,000 people are expected to lobby delegates.

The NExBTL facility will be Neste's third such project, and is intended to have a maximum capacity of 800,000 tonnes a year. Demand for biofuels is expected to rise greatly over the next few years, as they are often cited as a good way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and are viewed as a renewable alternative to crude oil which has been at record high prices in recent months. The site has been strategically selected to be close to Malaysia and Indonesia, both of whom are leading world suppliers of palm oil, which is intended to be the main fuel for the plant. Between them they account for 80% of global production. However, the use of palm oil is controversial, as some environmental scientists and campaigners believe using it will have a negative effect as increased demand in turn causes higher food prices and greater levels of deforestation. Earlier this year, Greenpeace attempted to stop a palm oil tanker ship destined to Neste's existing biodiesel plant in Porvoo, Finland, but failed to stop the delivery. In addition to the Porvoo plant, which began operations earlier this year and is at its capacity production of 170,000 tonnes, Neste plan a second plant to open in 2009. The new plant will increase demand for palm oil, as it will require 200,000 hectares of palm oil plantations to supply the million tonnes of oil it requires per annum. \"The new plantations are to be set up mainly in Indonesia, and increasingly in swamp rain forests,\" said Greenpeace's Lauri Myllyvirta. When such terrain is cleared of trees, the peaty soil begins to dry out. \"In the years that follow, it releases all of the carbon that had been stored in it\", Myllyvirta continues. He concludes that he believes palm oil cultivated in such conditions produces ten times the carbon dioxide emissions of fossil fuels. Jarmo Honkamaa, director of Neste's biofuel sector, countered these claims with his belief that the gas balance remains positive and points to Neste statistics which say biodiesel diesel produces 40-60% less greenhouse gas emissions than standard diesel. Another potential problem has been highlighted by Citigroup, who voiced concerns that Neste may not be able to complete the project on time and within the intended budget. Recently, Neste added a standard diesel production line at their Porvoo refinery. This was finished this year, approximately one year late and at an actual cost of \u20ac750 million, versus a budget of \u20ac500 million.

But it was the Liberal party which first brought a full-blown policy to the public. In the months since the Green Shift initiative was brought forth, the political pundits and activists have both talked about this year as the first election where the environment would be a major issue on the minds of voters, and possibly a decisive one for the electorate. It's indeed true the environment ranks very high in minds of voters across the country, particularly among young voters. One national survey of Canadians between 18 and 25 finds the environment is the top issue. A poll of all voters found it to be the third most important single issue over all, behind the economy and health care, but the poll suggested that no one issue has really caught the attention of the electorate with many issues gaining similar attention. The parties themselves seem indecisive, trying to claim a focus on environmental issues but rarely making specific proposals or promises, with the notable exception of the Liberals whose platform has been targeted by opponents and commentators as \"wildly experimental\" and \"doesn't go deep enough\" by turns. Examining the platforms of the New Democratic Party regarding air pollution and global warming as available on their website, one is struck by a lack of substance. Reference is made to C-377, the Climate Change Accountability Act, which the NDP calls \"Layton's Kyoto-Plus Bill\", which was passed in 2006. The party believes Canada can achieve its Kyoto requirements by 2012, though no mention is made of how a Layton government would do so. In June of 2008 the Liberals tabled a plan, the Green Shift, which they claim would reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions 20% under 1990 emissions - well below the 6% required by Canadian law when Canada ratified the Kyoto Accord - by 2020, which is rather after the 2008-2012 phase-in period required by that same law. The method of performing this reduction would be to shift the Canadian tax system, reducing income and revenue taxes by replacing them with taxes on greenhouse gas emissions. The plan generated considerable discussion and opposition, and the party has back-pedaled in some portions and added on in others, as well as announcing a couple of separate initiatives to soften the effects for farmers, homeowners, and fishermen among others. A more diverse approach than solely a \"Carbon Tax\" is proposed in the Green Party's platform, which presents an almost holistic approach of adherence to the Kyoto obligations, \"Cap and trade\" of carbon emissions, industry development with both green technology R&D and regulation as well as consumer subsidies, and their own version of a carbon tax. Alone of the parties they specifically mention the role of international diplomacy/trade as a part of their approach. Such an approach appears to be anathema to the Conservatives, whose mantra since their election has been that Kyoto cannot be complied with without forcing an economic recession on the country, and used the Throne Speech of 2007 to reiterate that position. They have opposed cap-and-trade schemes in the past, but their platform for this election states their plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions includes emissions caps for \"four air pollutants commonly associated with smog and acid rain,\" as well as \"tough emission reduction targets\". In contrast to the laundry-list of unconnected initiatives on the Conservative's website, the clean platform pamphlet created by the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois makes a simple and apparently heartfelt statement on the environment: Just how they plan to enforce the Kyoto obligations is not stated, though they do discuss a carbon market, and tax incentives for home heating upgrade and transportation. There seems to be a wide if somewhat shallow interest in the electorate as to just what each party is offering on the environmental file.

The study is based upon climate activity during the last 50 years, which can only be replicated with computer models which include human forcing (CO2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs)). However, even within a warmer world the summer of 2003 was anomalously warm in Europe. Most simulations of 2003 climate produce cooler weather in Europe than what actually happened.  It is not yet known if flaws in the models cause this difference, if the warmth of 2003 was part of a trend, or 2003 was merely unusually hot.

The Stern Review, the first about the economic effects of climate change, is published today. Commissioned by the British Government and prepared by Sir Nicholas Stern, former top economist at the World Bank, it forecasts that, if action is not taken now, the world will suffer an economic disaster on an unprecedented scale. 100 million people will be refugees from floods caused by rising water levels, drought caused by the melting of glaciers will affect 1 in 6 of the world's population, up to 40% of present wildlife species will become extinct and the world economy will shrink by 20%. Sir Nicholas claims that these forecasts are based on the best available scientific evidence about the extent and effects of climate change. He does not claim absolute certainty, only a high degree of probability that the world is facing economic catastrophe if action is not taken immediately. An expenditure of just 1% of the world's wealth now could avert it. Spending \u00a31 now could save \u00a35, or even more, in the future. The effects of global warming can be contained, says the Review, if about 1% of the world's GDP is invested in reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. This investment must take place over the next 10 to 20 years otherwise the effects of climate change could be disastrous on a scale comparable to the great wars and the slump of the first half of the last century. There has to be action at national, regional and international levels. The Review concludes that the actions to be taken include emissions trading, doubling investment in research and development of low carbon energy sources, curbing deforestation and supporting adaptation in poorer countries by developing crops appropriate to the changed climatic conditions. The Stern Review shows that the scientific evidence for global warming is \"overwhelming\", said Prime Minister Blair. Chancellor Gordon Brown said that Britain will take the lead in persuading the world of the seriousness of the problem. All the major political parties in Britain have been discussing climate change. The Review is attracting a great deal of media attention. Salient among the views being reported are those of a number of experts including the following: Professor Bill Mcguire, Benfield UCL Hazard Research Centre who says that Stern has greatly underestimated the effects of global warming. Martin Livermore, The Scientific Alliance asserts that \"climate is not driven primarily by human use of fossil fuels\" and that the money to be spent is unlikely to have much effect: it would be better spent on the world's poor. Pia Hansen, European Commission Spokeswoman says doing nothing is not an option, we must act now. Simon Retallack, UK Think Tank IPPR - this (Review) removes the last refuge of the \"do-nothing\" approach on climate change, particularly in the US. Tom Delay, The Carbon Trust - The Review offers a huge business opportunity. Richard Lambert,CBI Director Genera says that a global system of carbon trading is urgently needed. Charlie Kronick, Greenpeace - now the government must act and, among other things, invest in efficient decentralised power stations and tackle the growth of aviation. Concurrently with the publication of the Stern Review, the United Nations reports that emissions from the industrialsed world are still rising.  There has been a 2.4% increase in emissions across 41 industrialised countries in the first four years of this century. Britain, France and Germany are near to achieving their Kyoto Protocol targets, but the US is the biggest polluter and its emissions have been increasing. The Kyoto Protocol calls for a reduction of 5% of pollutants below 1990 levels. There has been a reduction of 3.3% since then but this has been the result of the collapse of industry in Eastern Europe which has counterbalanced the increases in the rich countries. The Stern Review suggests that the Kyoto targets are too modest."}, "5-76": {"heading": "China bans free plastic bags ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/China_bans_free_plastic_bags", "date": "9-January-2008", "text": "The People's Republic of China has banned free plastic shopping bags in a move to take effect from June 1, 2008. The decision made by the Chinese Cabinet, the State Council, is intended to reduce the amount of plastic bags used in China, currently being estimated at three billion per day. The State Council also announced that at the same time as the ban, the manufacturing, sale and even use of very thin plastic bags, which are defined as being under 0.025mm thick, will be banned. Any company that does not follow this ban can be fined. The ban of free plastic bags and complete ban on very thin bags will, the government hopes, help reduce the amount of crude oil used for plastic packaging, which is currently at five million tonnes per year according to Times Online.

Many supermarkets in the European Union have voluntarily adopted methods to reduce usage of plastic bags, which often also consist of charging for bags (e.g. Germany) or rewarding customer loyalty points for returning used carrier bags. Still, many of the world's leading polluting countries, including the United States of America, have not yet introduced any legislation intended to reduce the usage of plastic bags. The United States Environmental Protection Agency claimed that in 2000 only 1% of plastic bags in the United States were recycled. The People's Republic of China has attracted a lot of attention in the past for having possibly the highest greenhouse emissions in the world, disproportionate to the size of its economy, according to The Telegraph.

This directly contradicts assertions made by politicians within the administration of the current president, Donald Trump. The report notes, \"It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century[...] For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence.\" Officially, the report was submitted through the Trump Administration's Office of Science and Technology Policy, to which President Trump has not appointed a head. The official response from the rest of the White House, given to the press by White House spokesperson Raj Shah, reads as follows: \"The climate has changed and is always changing. As the Climate Science Special Report states, the magnitude of future climate change depends significantly on 'remaining uncertainty in the sensitivity of Earth's climate to [greenhouse gas] emissions[...] In the United States, energy related carbon dioxide emissions have been declining, are expected to remain flat through 2040, and will also continue to decline as a share of world emissions.\" The report clocks in at roughly 500 pages and places the human contribution to the increase in the Earth's temperature at 92\u2013123% since 1950.  As explained by co-author Katherine Hayhoe, the space over 100% indicates counteraction of forces that have a cooling effect, like sun-blocking dust kicked into the upper atmosphere by volcanoes.  Overall, the report calls the past 115 years \"the warmest in the history of modern civilization.\" The study cites several factors, called \"tipping points,\" that might make global climate change more intense, such as changes in El Ni\u00f1o and other major patterns in ocean currents, the loss of arctic and antarctic ice sheets, and the release of methane, a greenhouse gas, from rotting material as previously permafrozen ground begins to thaw and cites both the wildfires in California and Superstorm Sandy for effects due to global climate change.  It predicts one scenario in which ocean levels rise as much as 8 feet (2.4 m) by the year 2100. Unlike with previous studies on climate change released by U.S. government agencies, said one lead author, David Fahey of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Trump Administration does not appear to have made an effort to block publication of the report or alter the wording describing its scientific findings, though there were some alterations to the description of U.S. policy with respect to the Paris Climate Accords. Fahey remarked, \"I'm quite confident to say there has been no political interference in the scientific messages from this report...] Whatever fears we had weren't realized.\" Head of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry have both said publicly that carbon dioxide does not cause much global warming. Phil Duffy of the Woods Hole Research Center noted, \"This is a federal government report whose contents completely undercut [the Trump Administration's] policies, completely undercut the statements made by senior members of the administration.\" President Trump has announced plans to withdraw the United States form the Paris Climate Accords, in which participating countries pledge to reduce carbon emissions, and to loosen federal laws regulating fossil fuels.

The Stern Review of the Economics of Climate Change, commissioned by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, points to the need for urgent action to reduce carbon emissions if a world-wide economic catastrophe is to be avoided. The institution of global carbon trading, control of deforestation, increased investment in energy R & D and support to poorer countries in adapting to climate change are all key proposals in the Review. A leaked letter from David Miliband, Environment Secretary, to Chancellor Brown contains a package of tax proposals to promote the use of public transport and to encourage people to buy smaller cars and fly less. The proposals also include charges on petrol-guzzling cars, road pricing, levies on air travel and increased charges for landfill waste disposal. The findings of the Review and the promise of a Government Climate Bill, containing measures in response to the Review, received a mixed reception from employers and unions. Miles Templeman, Director-General of the Institute of Directors, said: \"Without countries like the US, China or India making decisive commitments, UK competitiveness will undoubtedly suffer if we act alone.

The Prince of Wales' Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change, formed by  14 of UK's leading companies shared this hope. Chairman of Shell UK, James Smith, expressed the hope of the group that business and Government would discuss how Britain could obtain \"first mover advantage\" in what he described as \"massive new global markets.\" The markets for low-carbon energy products are expected to be worth \u00a3300 billion by 2050.

Politicians world-wide are jumping on the \u2018green' bandwagon, but, if they want popular support, they'd better be sure that this is not simply the \u2018new witchcraft'. Ruth Lea, Director of the Centre for Policy Studies, also questions the notion that there is a \u2018scientific consensus' over global warming. She alleges that \"authorities on climate science say that the climate system is far too complex for modest reductions in one of the thousands of factors involved in climate change (i.e. carbon emissions) to have a predictable effect in magnitude, or even direction.\" About economic models, upon which Stern relied for his projections, her experience was that forecasting just two or three years ahead was usually wrong. She described the problem of drawing conclusions from combining scientific and economic models as \u2018monumentally complex'. She doubted whether international cooperation was really possible. She concluded that she thought that this Review was designed to cloak the motives of a government that wanted some moral justification for increasing taxation on fuels.

They can put a price on what ratifying the Kyoto protocol would cost but have no idea or capacity to put a price on the cost of not acting. They are tinkering around the edges of the problem and don't seem to know whether climate change is real or whether there is any urgency.\""}, "5-91": {"heading": "Hopes for treaty on climate begin to wither ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Hopes_for_treaty_on_climate_begin_to_wither", "date": "26-October-2009", "text": "International climate negotiations for a global climate treaty are not producing the required results in the given amount of time left before the Copenhagen conference in December, diminishing the hopes for a resolution at this conference. Major polluters have already decided that the only way for a plan of this scale to take effect is to have steps towards the reduction of greenhouse gases instead of creating a plan which takes immediate effect and shuts down production facilities.  Countries are likely to propose steps at the Copenhagen Meeting. Yvo De Boer, a Dutch Diplomat, has been overseeing the proceedings so far. \"There isn't sufficient time to get the whole thing done. But I hope it will go well beyond simply a declaration of principles. The form I would like it to take is the groundwork for a ratifiable agreement next year,\" commented Boer. The 192 countries which make up the United Nations show the gaps in-between their ideas. Wealthier nations are planning to help poorer countries with enforcing climate laws and investing in newer technology. 16 of the largest polluters have already begun planning on aiding poorer countries. Officials are attempting to narrow down issues which countries agree on, such as certain steps and the common goal to limit emissions. Negotiators plan to discuss how the treaty will be upheld at Copenhagen. Diplomats have raised the question of reliability, since most of the supporting countries have not enforced any binding climate legislation within their own countries. Until it is shown that all countries participating will uphold the treaty, nations are unwilling to enforce a treaty within their own country.

According to the Bureau of Meteorology, (BOM) 2005 was the hottest year since reliable, widespread temperature observations became available in 1910. Data collected by the Bureau  show Australia's annual mean temperature for 2005 was 1.09\u00b0C above the standard 1961-90 average. The Bureau of Meteorology says the result is more evidence of climate change. The Bureau's Blair Trewin said: \"We've seen things like the general retreat of the winter snow line. We've seen a marked decrease in the frequency of frost, especially in inland Queensland,\" Dr Trewin said. \"We've seen an increase in the number of extreme hot days.\" And the warming trend is likely to continue. \"All the projections we have from climate models we would expect to see continued warming through the 21st century,\" he said. \"Numbers like this ... are another piece of evidence that climate change is real and it's a real issue.\" Despite unseasonably cool weather in the South West of Western Australia, 2005 was a hot year over most of the nation, with the Northern Territory (NT) bearing the brunt. The NT area-average maximum temperature was 1.45\u00b0C above the long-term mean, the largest anomaly of any state or territory. The previous record of +0.84\u00b0C was set in 1998. The Bureau says that while these temperature departures may seem relatively small, a 1\u00b0C increase in mean temperatures is equivalent to many southern Australian towns shifting northward by about 100km. All States and Territories, apart from Victoria and Tasmania, recorded 2005 mean temperatures amongst their top two warmest years on record. The only region recording a cooler than normal year was a coastal strip of Western Australia extending from Cape Leeuwin to Carnarvon. Australia's previous warmest years on record were influenced by significant El Ni\u00f1o events, say the Bureau. However, no such event occurred in 2005, making the record warmth even more unusual. Since 1979, all but four years have been warmer than average in Australia. Australian temperatures have increased by approximately 0.9\u00baC since 1910 - consistent with global warming trends. Scientific studies have linked global and Australian temperature increases to the enhanced greenhouse effect. The early months of 2005 were also very dry over much of Australia with the January-May period being the 2nd driest on record. Australia's area-averaged rainfall is calculated from a network of around 5000 rainfall stations. Observations from this network reveal that, when compared to historical records, Tasmania was the wettest State in 2005, while Queensland and Western Australia were the driest. Over the New Year bushfires have caused havoc in many parts of Australia, with houses, farm stock devastated. Thousands of hectares of bushland and farmland have been burnt out. Environmentalists say the weather is a precursor of things to come: \"2005 gave us a little taste of what life will be like if we fail to tackle climate change,\" Greenpeace's Catherine Fitzpatrick said. \"The extreme heat and bushfires of New Year's Day 2006 showed that it isn't going to be fun. If action isn't taken soon to avoid catastrophic climate change, Australians will have John Howard to blame for failing to act when he had the chance.\" Ms Fitzpatrick said the Federal Government was as beholden to the coal and aluminium industries as the Japanese government was to whaling companies, and with far more devastating impacts. \"Today's figures should spur our Environment Minister ... to real action \u2013 ratify Kyoto, quit coal and move towards clean, renewable energy,\" Ms Fitzpatrick said. The Howard government claims it is taking appropriate action. Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell said he recognised climate change was the biggest modern-day environmental challenge. \"I think that climate change is alarming,\" he said on ABC radio. \"I regard climate change as the number one environmental challenge ... It is a huge and serious challenge. These figures add to the weight of evidence that climate change is real and it's a problem that the world needs to work together to seek to solve.\" Australia and the United States are the only developed nations to have refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol, which calls on countries to cut greenhouse emissions by 5.2 per cent below 1990 levels by 2012. The Government argues Kyoto will not work because it does not commit developing nations to reducing emissions. \"Kyoto excludes most of the emissions in the world. It only covers just over a third of the countries of the world and ... we need something that includes all countries of the world,\" said Senator Campbell. Many regions across the globe also reported an exceptionally warm year. According to a preliminary estimate released by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the global mean temperature for 2005 was about 0.48\u00b0C above normal, putting 2005 amongst the four warmest years globally since records commenced in 1861."}, "5-93": {"heading": "John Howard sets green energy targets ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/John_Howard_sets_green_energy_targets", "date": "25-September-2007", "text": "Australian Prime Minister John Howard has announced a national \"Clean Energy Target\".

However there is strong opposition for nuclear power in the Australian community. The Australian Greens have rejected the Prime Minister's assumption that nuclear power might be 'desirable' for Australia. The Greens say they challenge Mr Howard to show \"true leadership on climate change and nuclear non-proliferation.\" Greens climate change and energy spokesperson Senator Christine Milne said Mr Howard was \"playing politics\" by floating the idea and testing public opinion before developing a government position. \"Instead of pandering to US President George Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair - the two most unpopular leaders in the world today - Prime Minister Howard should demonstrate real leadership and put some authenticity into the government's response to climate change and terrorism,\" Senator Milne said. \"Nuclear power and nuclear proliferation are a threat to both.\" Senator Milne challenged advocates of nuclear power to explain what they will to do about nuclear waste, how large a public subsidy they are prepared to pay to prop up nuclear power, and why the Sustainable Development Commission was wrong when it recommended last month against expanding nuclear power in Britain. \"Australians have already had to subsidise uranium mining companies to clean up after mines have closed, while last week's Budget papers revealed that ANSTO can't estimate the cost of decommissioning the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor,\" Senator Milne said. \"When will advocates of nuclear power admit that it is too slow, too expensive and too dangerous to be a solution to climate change? Nor is there any safe way to dispose of the waste. It is not even safe to transport, a concern supported by the head of the International Energy Agency...\" said Senator Milne in a media release. \"Instead of turning to nuclear power, Australia should ratify the Kyoto Protocol, invest in renewable energy, adopt a national energy efficiency target and improve public transport. \"Several studies examining options to achieve deep cuts in Australian greenhouse emissions all show this goal can be achieved, cost effectively, without resorting to nuclear power,\" said Senator Milne in a media release. Greens leader Bob Brown says the Prime Minister is sending a message of approval for Indonesia to become a nuclear power. \"Australia and our region are essentially nuclear-free. Mr Howard is abandoning that security to grab uranium profits and facilitate an Australian role in nuclear enrichment,\" Senator Brown said. \"This robs Australia of its moral strength to argue against Indonesia resurrecting the Soeharto plan for 12 nuclear reactors and to advance its interest in Russian-built floating nuclear power stations.\" \"This will make our region much less secure for the next generation of Australians,\" Senator Brown said. \"John Howard has talked up regional terrorism. Now he is promoting nuclear power proliferation in our neighbourhood. At best his logic is faulty, at worst he is taking Australia into a future unnecessarily menaced by the nuclear threat,\" Senator Brown said. Labor MP Kelvin Thomson says John Howard's push towards nuclear power generation could heighten the risk of a terrorist attack. \"The problem with nuclear power is that more of it that is around, the easier it is for terrorists to get access to it and I'm not satisfied that in this day and age we can be absolutely certain that terrorists can't access it,\" Mr Thomson said. Mr Thompson said the Government should be focussing its interest on \"much safer and environmentally-friendly\" abundant renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power. Mr Thomson said Australia was a potential world-leader in solar power. \"Surely you exhaust all the other alternatives first before you say let's go down the nuclear road,\" he said. \"The problem with nuclear power is that more of it that is around, the easier it is for terrorists to get access to it,\" he said. \"I'm not satisfied that in this day and age you can be absolutely certain that terrorists can't access it.\" Union leader Bill Shorten, a federal Labor candidate at the next election, believes the issue is unpopular with the electorate. A survey in 2005 found 47 percent of Australians supported nuclear power and 40 percent opposed it. Professor Frank Muller from the University of New South Wales, said the framework to manage nuclear power needs to be put in place first. He says it could take decades before a nuclear power plant could operate. \"So it actually takes even longer to provide a greenhouse benefit than it does to build a power plant,\" he said. Professor Muller says nuclear power stations are expensive to build, and safety is a major issue. Opposition environment spokesman Anthony Albanese said: \"John Howard's nuclear fantasy is Australia's nightmare,\" Mr Albanese told reporters. \"Intractable problems with nuclear energy when it comes to economic costs, safety, disposal of waste and contribution to nuclear proliferation remain up to some 50 years.\" Mr Albanese said that if Mr Howard was serious about nuclear power he should say where a nuclear power plant would be built, and where the waste it produced would be stored. \"If he's so confident that nuclear energy is safe... I'm sure he'll have coalition MPs volunteering to have a nuclear reactor in their electorate and to store their waste in the electorate,\" he said. Mr Albanese said the current Labor policy remained opposed to nuclear energy in Australia."}, "5-95": {"heading": "Australian nuclear power plants rejected by states ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Australian_nuclear_power_plants_rejected_by_states", "date": "5-June-2006", "text": "Australian media reports that Prime Minister John Howard is expected to push a nuclear energy inquiry through federal cabinet this week. Meanwhile, a list of possible sites for nuclear reactors has been leaked by the Opposition to media. The locations, listed in 1997, include Adelaide, Darwin, Perth, Lucas Heights, Goulburn, Holsworthy, and Broken Hill in New South Wales and other sites. West Australian (WA) premier Alan Carpenter says the list of fourteen potential sites were a \"facade to soften up Western Australians into accepting a nuclear waste dump.\" The WA Premier said people would not only be surprised but \"stunned to learn that the federal cabinet considered possible sites... without disclosing them to any state government.\" Mr Carpenter said in a media release that the document mentions a site near Perth airport. \"People should wake up to what's happening around Australia, particularly in WA,\" said Mr. Carpenter. \"Only a few weeks ago, we had three prominent WA Liberal MPs supporting a nuclear waste dump in WA,\" he said. \"This is all a facade in the Howard Government's push to soften up West Australians for a nuclear waste dump.\" Premier Carpenter, whose Labor government stridently opposes uranium mining in WA, stated his opposition to a nuclear waste dump: \"I vehemently oppose the prospect of our State becoming the dumping ground for the world's nuclear waste and that is what will happen if we allow uranium mining in WA. The evidence is mounting and indisputable.\" The South Australian Government has ruled out any possible nuclear power plant in SA. \"A nuclear power plant would bankrupt our state,\" SA Premier Mike Rann said.  \"It would not be commercially viable and would not, in my view, be acceptable to the public.  Nuclear power plants need giant populations to sustain them, there is no-one coming to me from the commercial sector or the mining industry or anywhere else, suggesting a nuclear power plant.\" Earlier, Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said South Australia should build a nuclear power station to run a desalination plant. Premier Rann dismissed the idea as ridiculous and said comments by Mr Downer highlight divisions within Federal Cabinet. He said Mr Downer is at odds with the Federal Finance Minister Nick Minchin, who says the high costs of nuclear power would rule it out. Mr Rann says South Australia will not allow nuclear power. \"For once I'm agreeing with Nick Minchin,\" he said. \"I think Nick Minchin is right that a nuclear power plant isn't necessary and won't happen and I think that Alexander Downer is having a bit of a lend of him.\" Victoria's Energy Minister Theo Theophanous said nuclear energy in Australia did not make sense when the cost and problems of waste disposal were considered. Mr Theophanous has rejected a report that found nuclear power could be competitive with conventional energy generation if it was subsided with help from a taxpayer subsidy. A recent report found nuclear power could compete with gas or coal-fired electricity if taxpayers helped to pay for it or shouldered the risk of its production. The ANSTO report found nuclear plants could be built in the next 10 to 15 years and an Australian version would cost about $2.5 billion to establish. To make it viable, taxpayers would pay hundreds of million towards start-up costs, said the report. But Mr Theophanous said Victoria had already had concluded the nuclear proposal did not add up. \"I had my department look at this and provide a report to me more than a year ago in relation to the prospect of nuclear power,\" he said. \"The problem is a commercial one as much as anything else. It costs roughly double the price to produce power out of nuclear energy. If you're going to pay double the price, why not put in wind farms? Why not use renewable energy, which is even cheaper than nuclear energy?\" said Mr Theophanous . The Victoria Government urges householders to reduce greenhouse emissions by reducing daily energy consumption. A new campaign identifies simple measures residents can adopt to cut power bills and greenhouse emissions, including turning the heating thermostat to no more than 20C, washing clothes in cold water and turning appliances off at the switch when they are not being used. New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma has also declared his opposition to nuclear power. He said no nuclear power stations would be built in NSW as long as he is premier. Mr Iemma urged state opposition leader Peter Debnam to join him in opposing the construction of nuclear power plants in NSW. \"While ever I'm premier of NSW there won't be any nuclear power plants in NSW,\" he told reporters. Queensland Premier Peter Beattie says he \"would not jeopardize the state's coal industry by supporting a nuclear power plant.\" Mr. Beattie has ruled out uranium mining in Queensland to protect the state's huge coal industry. He said he would not support a nuclear power plant. \"The State Government would not support it,\" Mr. Beattie said. \"We have the power to block them and we would block them, we would not support nuclear power. Why would we have a nuclear reactor in competition with the coal industry?\" Mr. Beattie told media. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) chairman Don Henry says a nuclear debate must consider climate change. \"If the inquiry is just about nuclear power it will be a waste of taxpayers money because nuclear power is too dangerous, too dirty, and too slow to tackle climate change,\" he said. \"If the inquiry is going to be fairdinkum, it needs to look at that issue: what can we do right now to tackle climate change in Australia?\" Australian Greens climate change and energy spokesperson Senator Christine Milne said in a media release: \"Instead of turning to nuclear power, Australia should ratify the Kyoto Protocol, invest in renewable energy, adopt a national energy efficiency target and improve public transport. \"Several studies examining options to achieve deep cuts in Australian greenhouse emissions all show this goal can be achieved, cost effectively, without resorting to nuclear power.\" Greens Senator Rachel Siewert says: \"The nuclear industry is engaged in a concerted effort to be given one last chance for redemption... yet every step of the nuclear fuel chain, from mining, milling, enrichment and operating reactors to waste storage, is subject to the same human error, material breakdowns, complexity and incompetence as any other area of human endeavour.\" said Senator Siewert. \"The current inventory of nuclear waste will already present our descendents with a monstrous intergenerational headache. Allowing so much as a kilogram more of this material to be produced is simply immoral.\" The ACF say \"nuclear energy is not a solution to climate change.\" ACF President Professor Ian Lowe says \"Nuclear is too slow to provide any legitimate answer to climate change or to energy security for the developing world.\" The ACF report that, as an energy source globally, uranium provides less power than renewables do. \"Uranium is inextricably linked to very serious environmental and health problems via nuclear weapons and radioactive waste. There is nothing ideological about opposing its use...\" The Australian Newspaper reports that Prime Minister Howard is preparing to appoint chief scientist Jim Peacock, a supporter of nuclear power, and other high-level nuclear industry experts to the team. The public inquiry, to be undertaken by three or four selected experts is expected to \"examine the economics of nuclear energy, health, safety, environmental and proliferation issues as well as waste and storage.\" The taskforce will take submissions and is expected to prepare a report to Government within four or five months, with the Government's response early in 2007. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), Ian Smith, says \"at least three\" power plants would be required.  Mr Howard said the ANSTO report challenged the view that the cost of nuclear power was prohibitive.  Dr Smith told a Senate estimates hearing that Australia would require \"multiple power stations to make the industry viable\". Federal Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane said the nuclear energy inquiry would also include consideration of nuclear enrichment plants in Australia. Mr Macfarlane said he would consider a nuclear power plant in his own Toowoomba electorate. Prime Minister John Howard insisted he would not be deterred by the unpopularity of nuclear power."}, "5-96": {"heading": "Warmest global winter on record according to NOAA ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Warmest_global_winter_on_record_according_to_NOAA", "date": "16-March-2007", "text": "Although the United States experienced average temperatures for the December, 2006 to February, 2007 period, overall world temperatures were the warmest on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

The ocean-atmosphere system, El Ni\u00f1o, played a part in the season\u2019s record warmth, according to the report's authors, but its effects did not last long, as ocean temperatures in the central equatorial Pacific cooled more than 0.3 degrees C in February and were near average for the month.

On August 18, 2021, the US District Court in Anchorage reversed the August 2020 EIS, finding it did not analyze foreign greenhouse gas emissions, include alternative proposals not subscribing to the conclusion that leases afforded the right to extract \"all possible\" oil and gas from each lease tract, and failed to properly consider the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act (NPRPA)'s requirement to give \"maximum protection\" to 'surface values' in the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area (TLSA). In January 2021, US President Joe Biden signed an executive order that paused \"new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters\", a campaign promise of his.
