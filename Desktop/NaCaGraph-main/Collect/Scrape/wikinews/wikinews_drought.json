The money, to be channeled through UNICEF for its water and sanitation program, will be used to develop new wells and improve existing ones. UNICEF is to contribute a further \u20ac60,000, as well as technical expertise to the Ministry of Agriculture, who will carry out the bulk of the work. \u201cThe two-year water supply project targeting rural districts is very significant since people living in 45 villages and their 40,000 heads of cattle will have access to clean drinking water,\u201d said Joaquin Gonzalez, EU Representative in Djibouti. At the same time, the UN aid agency World Food Program (WFP) indicated that it is working with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF to gradually shift Djibouti's reliance on emergency aid to a Food for Work program, which it hopes will assist nomadic herders in Djibouti with long-term sustainability. \"What we are trying to do together with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF is, for example to dig wells so that despite drought, these herders will be able to irrigate their fields,\" said Simon Pluess, WFP spokesman.  \"And, together with the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, we will try and promote vegetable gardens.\" Djibouti has survived harsh drought conditions for the past 5 years. Groundwater is the primary source of water for drinking and irrigation, but has been difficult to exploit and is often contaminated. Almost 50 percent of people in rural Djibouti do not have ready access to properly developed source of drinking water. And, due to the ongoing drought, water availability for livestock is limited. Livestock have shown signs of distress and, subsequently, milk production is down substantially. Nearly half of all families in Djibouti's northwest were forced to migrate to find pasture for their livestock. As the droughts continue, the importance of properly maintained wells has become apparent. \u201cLife is harder and harder for us. Years ago there were more rains and also more pastureland for cattle. Now it is good for us to have functioning wells so that we can keep cattle here,\u201d said Anou Amada, farmer in the village of Andoli. A 2006 survey indicated that only 15 percent of wells in Djibouti were equipped with a protective concrete wall to prevent contamination. Andoli's well is one of many undergoing repair through WFP's Food for Work project. \u201cWFP couldn\u2019t do this alone, so we work with the Ministry of Agriculture and UNICEF to dig wells and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization for vegetable gardens,\u201d said Benoit Thiry, Director, WFP in Djibouti. When the project is completed in 2008, it will have increased Djibouti's water pump capacity by adding 25 solar-power pumps, which would compliment the current 61 diesel-powered pumps. \"The advantage of solar...is that it is much cheaper and requires less maintenance,\" said Omar Habib, UNICEF communication specialist. \"We want the people to participate and to appropriate these pumping stations. The government\u2019s role in the long term should be as restricted as possible,\" he added."}, "2-2": {"heading": "Study: floods, droughts more intense in past 20 years due to higher global temperatures ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Study:_floods,_droughts_more_intense_in_past_20_years_due_to_higher_global_temperatures", "date": "19-March-2023", "text": "On Monday, Nature Water published a study by two NASA Goddard Space Flight Center scientists concluding the \"strong\" link between the global mean surface temperature and water-related extreme weather led the increase in the severity of events like floods and droughts in the past two decades. Authors Matthew Rodell and Bailing Li wrote results suggest \"rising temperatures may be driving an increase in the total intensity and related metrics of hydroclimatic extreme events that cannot be attributed to the sporadic occurrence of\" regular climactic variations, such as the El Ni\u00f1o\u2013Southern Oscillation. They identified 1,066 regions that experienced periods of too much, or not enough rainfall from 2002 to 2021 with a new algorithm using observations from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE) and GRACE Follow-On (GRACE-FO) satellites. This classified 505 'wet' clusters and 561 'dry' clusters, with an increasing severity of events in the seven years since 2015, which were recognized as among the warmest in history. From 2015 to 2021, the number of 'most extreme' events, among the 30 wettest or driest, increased to four from three per year. Monday's study noted an increase in the wet-to-dry event ratio from 15\u00b0 S to 20\u00b0 N, and a decrease in three areas between 15\u00b0 N and 50\u00b0 N, supporting the hypothesis that wet and dry areas are inversely affected by extreme events. The most intense dry event observed was a record-breaking South American drought from 2015-2016, while the greatest pluvial had been ongoing since 2002 through 2021, affecting most of sub-Saharan Africa above 10\u00b0 S and leading to flooding and Lake Victoria to rise to its highest levels ever in 2020, inundating homes and infrastructure. Rodell, the lead author, told the Associated Press (AP): \"I was surprised to see how well correlated the global intensity was with global mean temperatures.\" Speaking to CNN, he explained: \"We thought, well, maybe this is related to global warming, because we do know the past seven or so years have been the hottest on record [...] Sure enough, there was a significant correlation between this total worldwide intensity of these events and the temperature record.\" About the study's reliability, he said: \"What I feel more confident about is that as the world warms, we\u2019re going to see the greater global intensity of all the wet and dry events increase, meaning they\u2019re going to be more frequent, larger and more severe in total [...] What happens in a regional sense is a little bit more difficult to say with certainty. \"The study is another way for people to recognize that climate change affects everyone [...] It\u2019s not just about the temperature rising on average around the world, it\u2019s the actual weather events that have severe impacts on people that may be increasing in intensity and frequency.\" Richard Seager, a climate specialist of Columbia University's Lamont\u2013Doherty Earth Observatory, told the AP: \"Looking forward into the future, in terms of managing water resources and flood control, we should be anticipating that the wetter extremes will be wetter and the dry extremes will get drier [...] everything\u2019s going to get amplified on both ends of the dry-wet spectrum.\" On Rodell and Li's use of metrics from GRACE, he said: \"This study uses novel [satellite] data to confirm that human-driven warming is driving the climate system to more extremes of extended both wet and dry episodes.\" Park Williams, a University of California, Los Angeles bioclimatologist, told the AP: \"It\u2019s incredible that we can now monitor the pulse of continental water from outer space [...] I have a feeling when future generations look back and try to determine when humanity really began understanding the planet as a whole, this will be one of the studies highlighted.\" Meanwhile, CNN cited climatologist and Brown University Institute for Environment and Society Director Kim Cobb, who called the study \"a new lens on our rapidly changing water cycle, linking many of the headlines about droughts, floods and wildfires to this global analysis. \"This finding really reinforces the trends that we see from analysis of rainfall data and climate model output, and in that sense adds significant evidence to inform emergency planning and response, infrastructure planning, agricultural practices, and water resource management under continued warming.\" Rodell has been the Acting Deputy Director of Earth Sciences for Hydrosphere, Biosphere, and Geophysics at Goddard since 2021. Li has been an assistant research scientist at the Hydrological Sciences Laboratory at Goddard, and at the University of Maryland, College Park since 2017. In its 2021 report, the United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change reported a 70% increase in the frequency of droughts that would typically occur every ten years and a 30% increase in the frequency of comparable flooding. Moreover, scientists have said global warming could amplify the occurrence of 'weather whiplash', rapid swings between extreme conditions like in the US state of California, which recently experienced heavy rain and snowstorms after a megadrought.

This is a country where one in three, (ten million people) is suffering from a severe  drought, a situation complicated by warring rebel factions. In 2009, UNICEF discontinued air deliveries to areas controlled by the Islamic insurgent group al-Shabab due to militant threats. Last week al-Shabab said it would welcome the presence of humanitarian groups, provided aid groups did not have a \"hidden agenda\". On Wednesday, the United Nations airlifted supplies to a part of the country controlled by al-Shabab, flying five metric tons of medicines, food and water supplies to Baidoa, a rebel-held  town, 155 miles south of Mogadishu.

The agency explained that the mainly Somali refugees in Kenya's overcrowded Dadaab camps urgently need to be protected from the worst effects of the torrential rains. Most of Kenya is suffering from the effects of the prolonged drought; however, along the Indian Ocean Coast and the northeastern region of the country, people are being pounded by torrential rainfall. UN refugee spokesman Andrej Mahecic said many of those affected by the flooding are Somali refugees living in Kenya's overcrowded Dadaab camps. \"We fear that the looming El Nino phenomenon [...] a change in the atmosphere and ocean of the tropical Pacific region that produces floods, droughts and other weather disturbances in many regions of the world-may now threaten the 338,000 mostly Somali refugees in the two camps, which in any case usually are flooded for three months every year,\" he said. Although the yearly floods are predictable, Mahecic commented that the UNHCR is limited in what it can do ahead of time to protect the refugees from their destructive impact. Mahecic says the UNHCR began digging trenches and placing sandbags around hospitals, bore holes and other strategic locations in both camps, when heavy rains started three weeks ago. Without these and other measures, he says many sections of the camps would have been inundated. \"We are also preparing to locate to higher ground within the camps refugees who might be worst affected by the floods, particularly the chronically ill, disabled people, the elderly and children and teenagers on their own,\" he stated. When asked why camps were built on areas prone to flooding, he replied that the government allocated the areas. \"There is very little choice on where you can put a camp,\" he added.

Snowy Hydro Limited, the company which operates the scheme, has predicted that water levels in Lake Jindabyne will fall below  the threshold needed to operate power turbines by mid to late May. Lake Eucumbene, the second water source for the scheme will fall below its threshold by late July or early August. A statement by the company claims that over the last decade, water levels have continued to fall as the drought continues. The drought has lasted longer than the region's previous worst which lasted from 1936 to 1946. According to the company, water flows are around 30 percent lower than average, with the last eleven months flows being lower than those recorded in 101 years. It is also feared that low water stores may affect the supply of water for some towns in the region.

War in parts of the region is an extra exacerbating factor. The countries need immediate food, water, seeds and any other agricultural product, according to the Rome-based Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), which reports that millions of people are on the brink of starvation due to the recent severe droughts that have been devastating the area. \"The whole area is affected,\" FAO representative Shukri Ahmed said. \"The situation is deteriorating.\" Local newspaper reports gave an official death toll at 30 famine-related deaths, said Mr Ahmed. Many had not expected that the area's dry season would be as severe as it has been, and did not anticipate the effects. Others, such as Yves Engler, expect famines and massive starvation to continue in the region as long as the IMF continues to influence economic policies in the region. Yves Engler has claimed, consistently with Amartya Sen's analysis, that the IMF is responsible for worsening or actually creating famine in Malawi (2002), Ethiopia (2003) and Niger (2005). The present drought has been said to be getting worse by the day, and the total figure for those who need food from the World Food Program could rise from today's 1.2 million, to exceed 2.5 million people, according to United Nations (UN) spokesman Stephane Dujarric at the organisation's New York headquarters. The FAO had called for domestic food purchases in areas where harvests were expected to be favorable, coupled with food aid imports elsewhere, the UN's Mr Dujarric said. Crops have failed, and local attempts at distributing supplies have been blamed on poor infrastructure and a lack of supplies. What makes the region's situation even more grave, is that the rainy season failed to aid in the production of much needed crops. Nearly one-fifth of the population of Djibouti were said to be facing food shortages and wide-spread starvation. Nearly $40 million is said to be needed to offset the famine. 64,000 tons of food are needed by the World Food Program, but only 16,700 were known to be available.

The study was performed in two national parks in California, United States. For the past twenty-five years, spotted owl habitat preservation has focused on keeping 70% or more of the total ground area covered by natural tree canopy, a tree density that leaves forests prone to wildfires and trees more likely to die during droughts. Both wildfires and droughts have become more frequent in the years since the program began. However, the previous studies upon which the 70% figure was based only measured overall canopy coverage. In this work, researchers used aerial LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging) imaging technology to scan areas within Kings Canyon National Park and Sequoia National Park in California. The regions were analyzed by distribution of foliage, tree height, and the sizes of the spaces between trees and stands. These data were then cross-referenced with decades of field studies showing the locations of hundreds of owl nests.  They found that spotted owls clustered in areas with very tall trees and stands almost exclusively, over 150 feet (48 m), avoiding areas that only had moderate or low canopy, regardless of how dense or wide. \"This could fundamentally resolve the management problem because it would allow for reducing small tree density, through fire and thinning,\" said lead author Malcolm North, of UC Davis and the USDA Pacific Southwest Research Station. \"We've been losing the large trees, particularly in these extreme wildfire and high drought-mortality events. This is a way to protect more large tree habitat, which is what the owls want, in a way that makes the forest more resilient to these increasing stressors that are becoming more intense with climate change.\" The spotted owl gained national prominence in the United States during the 1990s, when environmentalists' efforts to preserve its habitat resulted in federal measures forbidding logging on large swaths of land, as well as federal limits on the sales of harvested wood. There was a 1995 U.S. Supreme Court case which was preceded by lawsuits on the part of timber companies and by years of large protests by timber workers and their communities who feared job losses.  For a time, it seemed that the spotted owl was also threatened by competition from the faster-breeding barred owl, which had moved west into its territory.

It stands by its overall conclusion that \"mass losses from glaciers and reductions in snow cover over recent decades are projected to accelerate throughout the 21st century, reducing water availability, hydropower potential, and changing seasonality of flows in regions supplied by meltwater from major mountain ranges.\" The IPCC had recently come under fire during the 2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference, when selectively leaked e-mails, hacked from the University of East Anglia, reportedly showed that some scientists were attempting to suppress findings by other climatologists that did not agree with their own findings."}, "2-41": {"heading": "Ethiopia appeals for food aid for over 6 million ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Ethiopia_appeals_for_food_aid_for_over_6_million", "date": "23-October-2009", "text": "The government of Ethiopia has appealed the international community for food aid for 6.2 million people that it says are in danger of starvation.

According to Business Desk of the Brunei Times, AusAID promised AU$3.2 million in funding, while GEF promised US$1 million.  The country was the first in the Pacific to make a deal with the World Bank. The funding was part of a US$530 million (NZ$635 million) package announced at yesterday's Pacific Energy Summit in Auckland involving New Zealand and the European Union, Australia, the Asian Development Bank, the European Investment Bank, the Japan International Cooperation Agency, the World Bank Group, and the United Arab Emirates.  Also at the summit yesterday, New Zealand's Foreign Affairs Minister Murray McCully had announced a national commitment of USD$54,262,000 (AU$51,861,000 NZ$65 million, \u20ac42,178,000) to Pacific region energy solutions, of which US$8,348,000 (AU$8 million, NZ$10 million, \u20ac6,483,000) would be specifically earmarked for renewable energy and improved energy efficiency in the Cook Islands, Kiribati, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Tonga, and Tuvalu. Kiribati is heavily dependent on diesel fuel for most of the energy available on the national power grid, which supplies power to half Kiribati's population of 110,000. In addition, a third of the country's population lacks access to electricity. Once installation of the solar panels is complete, they are estimated to reduce diesel consumption by 230,000 liters (60,760 gallons) a year and give access to the electricity to some parts of the population that currently have no electricity.

This created the potential to drive up standard operating costs. Mele has also noted these additional costs though are still lower than the cost of diesel power.

This semi-volatile plant  hormone was detected in the air above the plants in the experiments conducted in a walnut grove near  Davis, California. According to the scientists the chemical may be a sort of immune response that help protect the plants. Acetylsalicylic acid, commonly called aspirin, had originally come from the bark of Willow trees. It had never been observed to be emitted as a gas. The researchers observed spikes in methyl salicylate after nighttime temperatures dipped low, which suggested the plants were reacting to cold stress. The peaks were higher during a dry period, pointing to combined stress of cold nighttime temperatures and mild drought. Laboratory observations have shown that numerous plants produce methyl salicylate, but this is the first time the phenomenon has been observed in nature. Previous studies have shown that plants being eaten by animals produce chemicals that can be sensed by other plants. A study conducted in 1997 found that methyl salicylate is produced by tobacco plants inoculated with tobacco mosaic virus. Emitting methyl salicylate may be a means for the plants to warn other plants about a threat. The finding may help to more readily identify plants under stress by monitoring for the airborne distress signal."}, "2-56": {"heading": "Weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz wins the Philippines' first-ever Olympic gold medal ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Weightlifter_Hidilyn_Diaz_wins_the_Philippines%27_first-ever_Olympic_gold_medal", "date": "30-July-2021", "text": "On Monday, Filipina weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz won the gold medal at the Tokyo Olympics in women's weightlifting in the 55\u00a0kg category during her fourth Olympic games.

Zimbabwe is in the grip of a chronic drought and with food supplies running low, thousands fear starvation after they were told they could no longer supplement their food supply with crops grown themselves. A police spokesman told a UN news agency that they were under government instruction to prevent urban farming. Police spokesman Wayne Bvudzijena said \"a lot of harm is being done to the environment. Why can't those who want to cultivate crops go to rural areas, where people are being allocated farms under the land reform programme?\" People living in urban areas had taken to growing their staple crop - maize - and other grains in patches of land near their houses. Much of the land being used had already been earmarked for cultivation, but the police have been told to ignore any such designations. A non-governmental organisation, Environment Africa, agreed with some of the policy. \"We totally understand and appreciate the need for urban people to supplement their incomes, but they should not do it the wrong way. Ideally, farming should be done on farms, not in towns. What we have witnessed is an irreparable damage to the environment, which will certainly have dire consequences for our beloved cities,\" said an official.

Climate change, food and water shortage and a decline in biodiversity threaten humanity's survival, so urgent action is necessary, the report warns. UNEP's Global Environment Outlook: environment for development (GEO-4) report involved the work of about 390 experts in various fields from around the world. While the GEO-4 report salutes some improvements, for example the increased public awareness of environmental issues and political interest, it also warns that \"There are no major issues... for which the foreseeable trends are favourable.\" Although the report sets out a gloomy scenario, its main aim is to call for action. The report finds that despite \"visible and unequivocal\" evidence of climate change caused by human activity, the global response is \"woefully inadequate\" and shows \"a remarkable lack of urgency\". It criticizes highly-polluting countries that refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol, and the industrial sectors that lobbied against it. Negotiations for a new Protocol to curb climate changes will start in December. Although the emission of ozone-layer damaging chemicals has decreased by 95 percent, the spring hole in the ozone layer is larger than ever. UNEP calls the way Europe and North America have dealt with the problem of acid rain \"one of the success stories of recent decades\", while the challenge remains in countries like China, India and Mexico. As far as water is concerned, the report warns that \"The escalating burden of water demand will become intolerable in water-scarce countries.\" Contaminated water and lack of sanitation services already affect 2.6 billion people, being the single leading cause of death in developing countries with 3 million deaths annually, mostly in children younger than five. Although agricultural efficacy has increased, up to a third of the global population is affected by soil erosion, nutrient depletion and water scarcity. This is the first UNEP report which addresses specific problems in individual continents. In Africa, desertification and declining food production are key problems, while agricultural subsidies in developing countries decrease trade profits. Bushmeat trade is also mentioned, for example in the Congo Basin, where the trade is at six times its sustainable rate. In Asia, urban air quality, fresh water and increasing waste problems are among the priorities. The illegal traffic in electronic and hazardous waste worldwide is mentioned separately as an emerging challenge. Overconsumption, high energy use and transport problems cause concern in Europe, while North America is, according to the report, struggling to address climate change. Urban growth is a particular concern in Latin America. 2007 is reported as being the first year in history when more than half of all people lived in cities. The Polar regions are already feeling the impact of climate change, ozone layer effacement and pollution. Achim Steiner, Under-Secretary General of the U.N. and director of UNEP, said that \"There continue to be 'persistent' and intractable problems unresolved and unaddressed. ... Meanwhile, institutions like UNEP, established to counter the root causes, remain under-resourced and weak.\" \"There have been enough wake-up calls ... I sincerely hope GEO-4 is the final one. The systematic destruction of the Earth's natural and nature-based resources has reached a point where the economic viability of economies is being challenged and where the bill we hand on to our children may prove impossible to pay,\" Mr Steiner warned."}, "2-61": {"heading": "Wildfires still burn in Oklahoma, Texas ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Wildfires_still_burn_in_Oklahoma,_Texas", "date": "4-January-2006", "text": "NORMAN, Okla. \u2013 National Weather Service officials are warning of continued fire dangers throughout Oklahoma and Texas due to serious drought conditions.

A National Guard helicopter and firefighters from North Carolina were sent to battle a blaze near the town of Davis, in south-central Oklahoma, on Tuesday. Meanwhile, the BIA sent two airplanes to help fight a fire near Eufaula, in eastern Oklahoma. Three other BIA aircraft aided crews fighting fires near Wewoka, in central Oklahoma, and additional fires were reported near Knowles, Oklahoma City, Ponca City and Tishmingo. Authorities said additional National Guard helicopters and Forest Service planes are available to battle other fires as they break out. The Oklahoma State Medical Examiner\u2019s Office said one man has died from injuries sustained from recent wildfires.

The governor\u2019s office said the state continues to await word on a request for a federal disaster declaration made Friday. A disaster declaration by President George W. Bush would qualify Oklahoma for federal funds to place firefighters ahead of where blazes are burning, and would provide temporary housing assistance and low-interest loans for those whose homes or businesses have been destroyed. Texas authorities say they have 92 aircraft and 650 state workers working to fight fires, and have been joined by crews from Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Tennessee, and Wisconsin.

One full grown dinosaur and two young ones are the first evidence of any burrowing dinosaur to be discovered by scientists and is also the first evidence that a dinosaur cared for their offspring in dens. \"Burrowing behaviour allows vertebrates to escape harsh environmental conditions. Small dinosaurs could potentially have withstood severe conditions, such as drought or ... temperature extremes. Survival of terrestrial vertebrates at the end-Cretaceous event has been attributed to sheltering behaviour, with the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs resulting from their inability to find an appropriate cover,\" said Montana State University's chief researcher, David Varricchio. The new dinosaur has been called \"Oryctodromeus cubicularis\" which is being defined as the \"digging runner of the lair.\" \"Here we have the burrow, den, an adult with traits for digging, and two juveniles, all in the same place. It doesn't get much better than that,\" said researcher at Emory University, Anthony Martin. The remains were found in an area that was once covered by an ancient flood, but Varricchio states that the flood was not the cause of the dinosaurs death. \"The bones are disarticulated; they are not in life position. It's not like they were sitting in the burrow and a flooding event filled the chamber with sediment and they were entombed. They must have died, undergone decay and then the burrow was filled,\" added Varricchio. The fully grown dinosaur is at least 2.1 meters long and weighed nearly 22 to 32 kilograms.

Robert Zoelick, World Bank president, said that food prices have risen 36% over the last year,  pushing 44 million more people into poverty since last June. About 1.2 billion people are extremely poor. He warned that a further increase of 10% in the cost of food would move  an additional 10 million persons into extreme poverty, and there was no sign of a near term  reversal  in  the inflation of food prices, which affects the developing world disproportionately. \"We have to put food first and protect the poor and vulnerable, who spend most of their money on food,\"  said Zoellick. \u201cThe general trend lines are ones where we are in a danger zone\u2026 because prices have already gone up and [food] stocks are relatively low,\u201d he said. The cost of the  basic foods, such as  wheat, maize and soy are all surging. Only rice has shown a slight decrease in price. The steep rise in the cost of food is being driven by a combination of factors, including bad weather in food exporting areas such as Russia, Ukraine, North America and China,  rising energy costs that increase the cost of producing and transporting food, and the incentives for  farmers in many countries to produce crops for biofuels  instead of for food. \"The linkage between food and fuel is much tighter than it was ten years ago,\" said Zoellick. Additionally,  the change in diet of the growing middle class  in developing countries means they  consume more meat and pork products which take increased grain to produce and drives up the price of feed stocks. National food investment and export policies of some wealthier countries are affecting poorer nations. For example, China is acquiring large amounts of land in Africa to grow food for the needs of the Chinese; Saudi Arabia has given up wheat production to invest overseas for food, and a drought in Russia has led it to implement an export ban on wheat.

It may be the largest member of its species ever found outside its natural range in Southeast Asia.  Another Burmese python measuring 18 feet and 9 inches (5.7 m) was found in 2020, but it only weighed 104 pounds (47.2 kilograms). In a search documented by National Geographic, the team captured the current snake in December 2021 by tagging a male \"scout snake\" named Dionysius with a GPS tracking device and releasing it into the western Everglades. \"How do you find the needle in the haystack? You could use a magnet, and in a similar way our male scout snakes are attracted to the biggest females around,\" said wildlife expert Ian Bartoszek, the team's project manager. Pythons are an invasive species in Florida.  Removing female snakes from the environment before they lay their eggs is the Conservancy's preferred strategy for limiting python breeding.  When the team saw that Dionysius was spending several weeks in one area, they concluded he'd found a sexually mature female and set off to retrieve him. It took twenty minutes of wrestling and three adult humans to carry the snake to a vehicle, in which it was taken to a laboratory in Naples, Florida and euthanized.  Upon necropsy, it was found to contain over 122 healthy but unfertilized egg follicles. Pythons were introduced to Florida in the 1970s, probably by being sold as pets.  While there is a history of individual pet owners illegally releasing exotic animals into the wild after they grow larger than expected, the destruction caused by Hurricane Andrew in 1992 also allowed animals from a serpent center to escape to the Everglades and other habitats, where they reproduced in great numbers. Since then, they have disrupted the food chain by eating local animals, including endangered animals: the stomach of this snake contained the remains of a white-tailed deer.

The researchers say this technology could develop into a means of helping premature human babies survive, but it has also drawn concern from bioethicists. According to first author Emily Partridge and her team, previous efforts at creating an artificial womb have failed because the pumps used, to provide oxygen and nutrients to the developing animal, put too much stress on the heart, causing circulatory failure; and because they used open-fluid systems, which were easily exposed to germs.  Partridge et al.'s system uses a closed-fluid apparatus, which they've called the Biobag. The sound of a maternal heartbeat was played in the room where the fetuses were kept. The animals housed in the artificial womb showed normal blood gases and their lungs, brains and nervous systems showed normal development.  They opened their eyes and grew wool. When they were removed from the circuit and dissected, their brains, lungs and other organs were found similar to those of lambs delivered by hysterotomy (Caesarean section) when nearly full term. Although lambs often serve as an experimental model of fetal development, the researchers concede that not all of their findings can be translated to humans.  While the lambs' brains appeared healthy, they also develop certain traits much earlier than human brains, so not all of these effects may be attributable to the Biobag system. The researchers also acknowledge the startling appearance of a fetus wrapped in plastic. \"It is important to consider that the comparator is the extreme premature infant on a ventilator and in an incubator,\" reads the official paper. \"We feel that parents will be relatively reassured that their fetus is being maintained in a relatively protective and physiologic environment.\" One of the researchers, Dr. Alan Flake, also of the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, says the apparatus may be ready for testing on human babies in three to five years. The researchers noted premature birth is the leading cause of infant mortality in the United States, with about nine out of ten infants born at 23 weeks gestation or earlier suffering complications such as mental retardation, deafness, blindness, paralysis, and cerebral palsy.  When a fetus is removed from the amniotic fluid and placed on a respirator, the shift from liquid to gas can cause the lungs to stop developing. The most common direct cause of death among premature infants is failure of the lungs to properly oxygenate the blood. Bioethicist Dena Davis of Lehigh University notes this invention raises several ethical issues. \"If it's a difference between a baby dying rather peacefully and a baby dying under conditions of great stress and discomfort then, no, I don't think it's better,\" she told National Public Radio.  She also notes the problem of babies who would otherwise have died surviving with severe side effects and the implications that this has for the abortion debate: \"Up to now, we've been either born or not born. This would be halfway born, or something like that.\" Scott Gelfand of Oklahoma State University worries that women who would otherwise seek abortion could be pressured into putting their fetuses in Biobags instead or that employers would punish mothers who took maternity leave instead of using an artificial uterus. \"I want to make this very clear: We have no intention and we've never had any intention with this technology of extending the limits of viability further back,\" Dr. Flake said in response to these issues. \"I think when you do that you open a whole new can of worms.\" He went on to call gestating fetuses younger than 23 weeks \"a pipe dream at this point.\""}, "2-90": {"heading": "United States: Two killed, more than a hundred injured in Amtrak train collision in South Carolina ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/United_States:_Two_killed,_more_than_a_hundred_injured_in_Amtrak_train_collision_in_South_Carolina", "date": "7-February-2018", "text": "Early on Sunday morning, Amtrak's passenger train number 91, the Silver Star, bound for Miami from New York, slammed into a stationary CSX freight train in Cayce, about ten miles (16 km) south of Columbia, capital of the US state of South Carolina.

The Amtrak locomotive and the leading locomotive on the freight train were destroyed; the Amtrak locomotive and some of its passenger cars derailed, and one of those cars was folded in half. Several freight cars were crumpled, Reuters reported. In a press conference, the state governor, Henry McMaster, said the Amtrak locomotive was \"barely recognizable\" and described it as \"a horrible thing to see, to understand the force involved\". Harrison Cahill, a spokesman for Lexington County, gave a count of 116 injured, up from an initial report of 70; according to Derrec Becker, public information officer for the South Carolina Emergency Management Division, injuries ranged \"from cuts and bruises to severe broken bones\". On Monday a Palmetto Health spokesperson said two patients were in serious and two in critical condition at their facilities. A spill of approximately 5,000 gallons of fuel from the freight train posed no safety hazard, according to officials. Passenger Derek Pettaway told the CNN network that like most others, he had been sleeping when the collision happened. He said Amtrak staff cleared the passengers from the train rapidly, and there was no panic; \"I think people were more in shock than anything else\", he said. \"Key to this investigation is learning why the switch was lined that way\", Sumwalt said. Amtrak's CEO, Richard Anderson, speaking to reporters on Sunday, held CSX responsible; he stated the track in that area is operated by CSX and the signals, which CSX operates, were not working at the time of the collision and a CSX dispatcher was therefore directing the Amtrak train's movements. Sumwalt noted an automatic monitoring and braking system called positive train control, which was not in use on the stretch of line, could have forestalled the collision. Several fatal incidents involving Amtrak trains have occurred in the past three months. On December 18, the inaugural train on a new route in Washington state derailed at high speed while crossing above a highway, killing three; on January 31, the driver of a garbage truck was killed in Virginia when he collided with an Amtrak train chartered to take Republican lawmakers to a retreat."}, "2-91": {"heading": "Oil rig in Gulf of Mexico sinks after explosion; eleven missing ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Oil_rig_in_Gulf_of_Mexico_sinks_after_explosion;_eleven_missing", "date": "23-April-2010", "text": "The oil rig Deepwater Horizon sank yesterday after an explosion Tuesday night that left eleven people missing. According to an officer from the US Coast Guard, the rig sank sometime in the morning. The rig had caught fire after an explosion of unknown origin occurred two days ago. 115 of the 126 workers on board the time of the explosion have been rescued after evacuating in lifeboats, either by the Coast Guard or from other ships in the area. The remaining eleven have not been located, although Coast Guard officials have expressed optimism that they are still alive. The environmental impacts of the explosion and subsequent sinking of the rig are unclear. While up to 13,000 gallons of crude oil per hour has been released from the rig, until now, the effects have been considered minimal, as it had been burned off in the fire. That does have the potential to change, though, according to David Rainey, vice president of the lessor of the rig, BP. The rig, built in 2001 by Hyundai Heavy Industries was owned and operated by Transocean. The rig was located roughly 50 miles southeast of the coast of Louisiana, and was under lease to BP since 2007. It was completing the construction of a new oil well, and was constructing a layer of cement in the well to reinforce it. This is considered dangerous, as it has the potential to produce an uncontrolled release of case, called a blowout. While the cause of the explosion has yet to be determined, a blowout is considered a possibility. One survivor of the explosion, who declined to give his name, told the The New York Times that he was lying in bed when the explosion happened. \"It caught me by surprise. I\u2019ve been in offshore 25 years, and I\u2019ve never seen anything like that,\" he recalled. Stanley Murray, the father of another survivor named Chad, an electrician, said: \"My son had just walked off the drill floor.\" However, Murray said that a neighbor did not make it in time, adding that his son told him that the missing eleven workers could not have made it out alive. \"The eleven that\u2019s [sic] missing, they won\u2019t find them,\" Murray said."}, "2-92": {"heading": "Australian\u2013US team of scientists finds Atlantic warming causes Pacific climate trends ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Australian%E2%80%93US_team_of_scientists_finds_Atlantic_warming_causes_Pacific_climate_trends", "date": "6-August-2014", "text": "A team of scientists from Australia and US has found a solution for a challenging problem in climate research. Climate models predicted more greenhouse gases would weaken the equatorial Pacific trade winds. While previous research supposed natural variability alone accounted for cooling in the eastern Pacific, this study highlights a previously overlooked climate feedback: as the Atlantic warms, it alters the winds over the Pacific, depressing the ocean temperature there. Coauthor Malte Stuecker of the University of Hawaii Meteorology Department reports that \"Our study documents that some of the largest tropical and subtropical climate trends of the past 20 years are all linked: Strengthening of the Pacific trade winds, acceleration of sea level rise [three times faster than the global average] in the western Pacific, eastern Pacific surface cooling, the global warming hiatus, and even the massive droughts in California\". His colleague cauthor Fei-Fei Jin adds, \"We are just starting to grasp the scope of the impacts of this global atmospheric reorganization and of the out-of phase temperature trends in the Atlantic and Pacific regions\". Coauthor Axel Timmermann of the University of Hawaii notes a further amplifying effect: \"Stronger trade winds in the equatorial Pacific also increase the upwelling of cold waters to the surface. The resulting near-surface cooling in the eastern Pacific amplifies the Atlantic\u2013Pacific pressure seesaw, thus further intensifying the trade winds [...] It turns out that the current generation of climate models underestimates the extent of the Atlantic\u2013Pacific coupling, which means that they cannot properly capture the observed eastern Pacific cooling, which has contributed significantly to the leveling off, or the hiatus, in global warming.\""}, "2-93": {"heading": "Asexual ants discovered ", "link": "https://en.wikinews.org/wiki/Asexual_ants_discovered", "date": "17-April-2009", "text": "According to research undertaken at the University of Texas at Austin (and recently published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B Journal), a species of ant (Mycocepurus smithii) found in the Amazon reproduces asexually.

Doctors have said that she is conscious and her condition is stable. Police sources say that Patkar has not been arrested as of now, but an First Information Report has been lodged against her for attempting to commit suicide. Activists of the Narmada Bachao Andolan tried to prevent the police from moving Patkar and some were arrested on rioting charges. Patkar, Jamsinh Nargave and Bhagwatibai Patidar began an indefinite fast on March 29, refusing food and medical care. They called on the government to reverse its decision to raise the height of the dam under construction from 110m to 121m Patkar said \"If the construction work for increasing the height of the dam is started, over 35,000 people will lose their land by the month of June.\" and that \"Yet, most of the villagers living along the Narmada river bank have not been provided alternative land holdings\". The Indian Water Resources Minister Saifuddin Soz and other central ministers met the protestors and called on them to end the fast, promising suitable rehabilitation. \"We urge Medha Patkar to break her fast. She is welcome to continue her protest and raise the issue with Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, my ministry and the courts,\" said Soz. On April 3rd, the Prime Minister Manmohan Singh appealed to the  hunger strikers to end their fast. Three union ministers are also planning to visit the dam site to personally supervise the rehabilitation work. The Sardar Sarovar Project involves the construction of a series of large hydroelectric dams on the Narmada River in India. Although first conceived of in the 1940s by the country's first prime minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, the project began only after 1979. Officials say that the dam is essential for drought-prone areas in Gujarat and Madhya Pradesh but the dam has been mired in controversy over its environmental impact, costs and benefits since the late 1980s. Local protests have coalesced under the Narmada Bachao Andolan (Save Narmada Movement) led by Medha Patkar. The World Bank was a funder of the SSP, but withdrew after an independent review in 1990.

One rebel said that at least US$ 95 million (\u00a363 million) from \u2014 Western governments and private charities \u2014 was diverted into rebel coffers. This was also noted in a declassified Central Intelligence Agency assessment of the famine situation titled Ethiopia: Political and Security Impact of the Drought, in which the report states, \"Some funds that insurgent organizations are raising for relief operations, as a result of increased world publicity, are almost certainly being diverted for military purposes.\" During the 1984\u20131985 famine, Ethiopia was fighting Eritrean and Tigray rebels in those two northern provinces, although Eritrea has since gained its independence. Since the countryside was out of the government's control, aid was brought in from neighboring Sudan. Some aid came in the form of food, while other aid came as cash which would be used by the aid agencies to buy grain from Ethiopian farmers. Rebels would disguise themselves as traders and merchants to get their hands on the currency. \"I was given clothes to make me look like a Muslim merchant. This was a trick for the NGOs,\" said Gebremedhin Araya, a senior member of the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). One such aid worker that brought the grain was Max Peberdy, who worked for the charity Christian Aid. Peberdy is seen in a photo with Araya buying grain. Araya said that only some of the sacks were filled with grain; the rest were filled with sand.  The transaction was overseen by a member of the Relief Society of Tigray (REST), the humanitarian wing of the TPLF.  The money was then given to TPLF leaders, including chairman Meles Zenawi, who has been Prime Minister of Ethiopia since 1991.  Zenawi has not commented on the allegations. Peberdy disputes the claims that he was duped, saying, \"As far as we were concerned and as far as we were told by REST, the people we were dealing with were merchants.\"  He added, \"It's 25 years since this happened, and in the 25 years it's the first time anybody has claimed such a thing.\" However, an exiled TPLF commander who lives in the Netherlands, Aregawi Berhe, is backing Araya's story.  He said the group got their hands on over US$100 million (\u00a366 million) of which 95% went to buy weapons and build up a hardliner Marxist party inside the rebel movement.  The remaining five percent would go to famine victims.  Berhe told the BBC that the group would put on a \"drama\" to get the money.  Berhe said, \"The aid workers were fooled.\" In response to the allegations, the charity Christian Aid issued a statement saying, \"There are allegations in the story which are against all of Christian Aid's principles and our initial investigations do not correspond to the BBC's version of events.\" Nick Guttmann, who is director of emergency relief operations for the group, says the \"story has to be put into context\".  \"We were working in a major conflict, there was a massive famine and people on all sides were suffering,\" Guttmann said, adding, \"Both the rebels and the government were using innocent civilians to further their own political ends.\" Bob Geldof, the Irish rock star who help organized Live Aid, said, \"We are talking about a disgruntled, exiled general.  The essence of the report also is not just about Live Aid.  It's that all monies going into Tigray \u2014 that would be Oxfam, Save the Children, UNICEF and Christian Aid \u2014 somehow, we were all duped and gulled.  And that's simply not the case.

The public was given limited access to the still-active construction site. Buses took viewers from the car park below to top of the dam wall. They ran every 15 minutes from 8:30 am to 4:00 pm. The dam is to supply fresh water to the city of Canberra. This is to provide water security for the city as droughts become more frequent due to global warming. It is a gravity dam, which holds back the waters through sheer mass. It is about 80 metres (about 260 feet) high. The dam is made from roller-compacted concrete. The concrete was laid dry and compacted with rollers. The concrete was made on site. Only the final touches use conventional concrete. In addition to the main dam, there are two saddle dams filling depressions in the landscape so flood waters flow over the spillway and not out the sides of the lake. The dam on the Cotter River has been under construction for four years. Concrete pouring is expected to take another two weeks. The site is then to be rehabilitated. Thousands of seeds were collected during constructions. These are to be replanted to replace the native flora. Work is expected to be complete by September. The dam replaces an old dam, first built in 1911 but subsequently expanded several times. Now heritage listed, it has been submerged by the waters of the new dam. Some materials were salvaged from the old dam to build the new, and some have been put on display. The river is named after Garrett Cotter, an Irish-born convict who was transported to Australia and lived in the area in the 1830s and 1840s."}}
