The body of a man was discovered on a street in Lancaster, California around 1:45 a.m PDT (UTC-7) Tuesday morning with an arrow stuck deep into his chest. Sheriff's deputies who responded to the crime scene at 13th Street and Avenue K initially thought the victim to have been homeless, but he was later identified as Angel Martinez, age 62, who resided in Lancaster. "Who would want to do something like that to an elderly person?" said Tony Martinez, a local resident who was among those who found the victim. "And what was an elderly man doing out here anyway that late?" The attacker, who struck by night, is being sought by authorities.
