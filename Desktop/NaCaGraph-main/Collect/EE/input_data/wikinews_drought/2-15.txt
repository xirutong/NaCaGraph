Columbus came out attacking in the 2nd half and it paid dividends in the 61st minute when Jason Garey scored the equalizer. Substitute Jacob Thomas scored the winner in the 83rd minute. The next Toronto FC game is away to DC United on September 29 while Columbus Crew faces Los Angeles Galaxy at home on September 30.
