Inaugural African Protected Areas Congress closes. The inaugural African Protected Areas Congress hosted in Kigali, Rwanda, closed on Saturday with delegates adopting the Kigali Call to Action, committing countries to greater investments in the conservation of nature. The conference ran from July 18-23, and was organised by Rwanda, the International Union for Conservation of Nature and the African Wildlife Foundation, with the aim of discussing the challenges and opportunities in the conservation of nature and wildlife across Africa. Over 2300 delegates were present representing countries, the private sector, indigenous groups and conservation organisations. Initiatives included the launching of a Pan-African Conservation Trust, with African governments encouraged to approve its establishment. This would see a $200 billion pan-African trust fund created for the financing of all 8,500 of Africa's protected areas in perpetuity. Congress closed with delegates adopting the Kigali Call to Action, committing countries to spending 1% of their GDP on funding biodiversity programs, alongside increasing collaborations between the public and private sectors. The Call to Action also called for the strengthening of the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities.
