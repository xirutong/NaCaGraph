2008 Boao Forum for Asia starts with sectors on economy, environment, and the Internet. "2008 Boao Forum for Asia" started two days ago in Bo'ao, Hainan, China, and participated with government and industrial executives worldwide. Because revolutions in the Web 3.0 era have made a major impact on global economy, several elites from the Internet industry like Kai-Fu Lee provided forecasts for this key industry in the forum. Furthermore, Vincent Siew, the vice-president elect, provided his comments in the forum. But two coalitions (Pan-Blues and Pan-Greens) declared different comments on Siew's participation. But due to a hot topic of environment and greenhouse effect , Rajendra Kumar Pachauri, winner of 2007 Nobel Peace Prize, commented on this forum: "There were several sectors on energy-saving, not governments, but the public should play a great role in this global warming era."
