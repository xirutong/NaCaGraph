Ballarat residents protest for climate action. Ballarat, Australia — The rural Australian city of Ballarat saw some residents take to the streets in a rally for climate action on Sunday. Initially beginning at 1pm outside the Ballarat Civic Hall, the protesters moved down Mair, Lydiard, and Sturt Street – passing the office of local MP Catherine King – before reaching the Ballarat Town Hall, where representatives from Ballarat Renewable Energy and Zero Emissions (BREAZE), the Ballarat branch of Extinction Rebellion, Environment Victoria, the Public Transport Users Association, and the Ballarat Trades Hall all spoke. While no political candidates spoke at the rally, independent Alex Graham and Greens member John Barnes – who are both standing for the seat of Ballarat in the upcoming federal election – both attended.
