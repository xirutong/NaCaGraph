7.1 magnitude earthquake in Fiji. The quake hit 579 kilometers below the Earth's surface about 100 kilometers North East of Ndoi, the US Geological Survey said. No damage or injuries have been reported following the quake and the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center said they did not expect it to trigger a tsunami as the quake happened far below the Earth's surface. Lasarusa Veutibau, a seismologist at Fiji's Mines and Resources Department, said the quake was too deep to have been felt anywhere in the Fiji Islands.
