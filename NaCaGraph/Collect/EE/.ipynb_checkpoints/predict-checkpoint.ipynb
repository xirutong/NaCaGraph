      " U.S. EPA submits 2003 greenhouse gas inventory to U.N.. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has released an official annual report to the United Nations (UN) on greenhouse gas emissions in the United States.  The report is drafted, held for 30 days of public comment, then released to the Secretariat of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) each year in April. This year's report is the ninth since the EPA began producing the emissions inventory in 1997, after the US signed and ratified the UNFCCC in 1992.  The UNFCCC, a legally non-binding treaty created to address global warming, is not as well known as the Kyoto Protocol, which is a more recently updated protocol based on that treaty.  The United States did not ratify the Kyoto Protocol; however, it was ratified by 127 other nations and went into effect for them on February 16, 2005. The EPA report covers the period 1990-2003, with particular emphasis on the 2003 period (there is a one-year delay in preparation).  Major findings include: The period beginning in 1990 is of interest, since that is the period addressed by the Kyoto Protocol, which attempts to reduce the average greenhouse gas emissions for each country to 5.2 percent below 1990 levels. Gases covered in the report included six major greenhouse gases.  The first three gases are produced both naturally and by human activity, but the last three gases are mainly produced by human activity: About 80% of the total emissions came from the burning of fossil fuels.   Other major natural greenhouse gases are water vapor (H2O), which actually traps more heat in the atmosphere than all the listed gases combined; and ozone (O3), a gas well-known for a \"hole\" in the ozone layer being discovered over the earth's polar regions in recent decades. \n",

      " Scientist: Sulfur remedy for greenhouse effect backed by data. Nobel Prize winner Professor Paul J. Crutzen has stated he has data to support his controversial claim that injecting sulfur into the atmosphere would negate the greenhouse effect. The data is intended to quiet critics of the theory he first discussed in the scientific journal Climatic Change in August, 2006. The 1995 Nobel Prize winner in chemistry stated \"Our calculations using the best models available have shown that injecting 1 million tonnes of sulfur a year would cool down the climate so the greenhouse effect is wiped out.\" The theory uses the idea that an added layer of sulfates in the stratosphere, approximately 16 kilometres above the earth, would reflect sunlight back into space and reduce the amount of solar radiation reaching the Earth's surface. Critics have shown that the earth has struggled for decades to reduce sulfur pollution, and how it is a component of acid rain that kills plantlife and animals. A large-scale experiment would be impossible to conduct, however scientists have noticed that massive volcanic eruptions have had similar effects on the earth. The 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines lowered temperatures around the world for two years, according to data taken at the time. Crutzen resparked discussion on the topic, a theory which has been dismissed up until now as dangerous. \"Until August this was a taboo issue. But the paper I published really set off some movement in this area. It never hit the level of seriousness which it has taken in the past months,\" Crutzen said. Environmental groups are skeptical but agree the idea should be investigated. \"This idea should be examined and as a last resort it can buy us a few decades,\" said Steve Sawyer, a policy adviser for Greenpeace International. \n",

      " Opening positions spark debate at Global Climate Change Conference. At the U.N. conference on Global Climate change in Bali, the early talk has focused on whether some of the major developed countries will commit to cutting greenhouse gas emissions in the coming years. European states are pushing for steep reductions in emissions, but environmentalists accuse some others of dragging their feet. The European Union's climate chief, Artur Runge Metzger, says his organization wants greenhouse emissions cut by half by the middle of the century. \"We would like to see global average temperatures rise no more than an average of two degrees compared to pre-industrial levels,\" Metzger said. \"And that would require that global emissions go down by at least 50 percent of the 1990 emissions by the year 2050.\" Greenhouse emissions are thought to be causing global warming. Metzger downplayed differences between the EU and other countries on reduction targets, saying he believes the response to the 50 percent proposal has been increasingly positive. He noted that Japan, Canada and some members of the U.S. congress have expressed support for the idea. Those same countries, however, have been targeted by environmental groups, who say they have failed in their initial statements here to come out strongly enough for significant cuts. {{w|Hans Verolme]] of the group WWF says Japan is being criticized for not including binding targets in its proposal for emission control discussions. \"That in our view would be quite disastrous. It would delay action and it would in fact lead to dangerous climate change,\" Verolme said. Japan says its proposal is merely an attempt to get the conversation started, and U.N. climate change chief Yvo de Boer has also sought to downplay any differences. De Boer repeatedly points out that the Bali conference is not meant to produce a new climate-change treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol. That 1997 agreement is set to expire in 2012. \"This meeting in Bali will not finalize a post-2012 climate change deal, that's much too complicated to do in 10 days, but what it can do is put in place a two-year process to work towards such a deal,\" De Boer said. Even the two-degree temperature rise that the European Union talks about is predicted to have serious effects on humans and the environment. The U.N.'s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has predicted such a rise would increase the frequency of damaging storms, and make 30 percent of the world's species more vulnerable to extinction. Thousands of delegates from more than 180 countries are meeting in Bali, which is due to run through December 14. \n",

      " Nobel prize winner Al Gore urges US and China to do more about global warming. Global warming campaigner and former U.S. Vice President Al Gore says it is time for humanity to stop \"waging war\" on planet Earth. Gore spoke today in Oslo after receiving the Nobel Peace Prize. He urged the two largest carbon-emitting countries — the United States and China — to make what he called the \"boldest moves\" to fight global warming. The United States has not ratified the Kyoto Protocol, the 1997 international pact that requires reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. China was not required to reduce emissions under the deal.  They also refused today to approve a new treaty designed to cut emissions by 25 percent to 40 percent by 2020. Gore said he would go to the U.N. climate meeting in Bali later this week to urge world leaders to meet as often as every three months to enact a global cap on greenhouse gas emissions by 2010. Gore shared the 2007 Nobel prize with the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, represented at today's ceremony by Rajendra Pachauri. Pachauri stressed the link between the fight against climate change and peace. He warned that severe climate change will trigger what he called \"dramatic population migration,\" as well as war over water and other resources. He also warned that up to 250 million people in Africa could face what he called \"increased water stress because of climate change. \n",

      " PBS show asserts greenhouse gases, atmospheric pollutants dimming future. This week, the Public Broadcasting Service aired a NOVA program titled “Dimming the Earth”, which presented research by leading scientists on the complex systems of our global climate and human activity's effect on it. One of the largest interactions (or \"inputs\") humans have with the atmosphere is the ever-increasing use of fossil fuels. Consumption has risen 2% per year for this decade. Fossil fuels burnt in factories and automobiles send their waste into our atmosphere in two forms. The first is CO2 and other greenhouse gases, which have received substantial attention in the last few years because of the way they trap heat in the atmosphere. The second is the tiny particles of sulfur dioxide, soot and ash, which scientists call aerosols (basically smog). Research into understanding the negative health effects of air pollution has resulted in the development of catalytic converters for cars as well as devices to remove particulate solids from industrial waste before it reaches the air. More recently, atmospheric scientists have come upon the phenomenon of the reduction of direct sunlight reaching Earth's surface— observing a nearly a 5% decline between 1960 and 1990, with evidence of a recovery since then. This has been dubbed the \"global dimming\" effect, and is probably due to the way these aerosols act upon clouds. It is important to realise that this does not represent a net loss of this much sunshine to the climate system - if so, large temperature declines would have been observed. Instead, the sunshine is absorbed elsewhere in the system, with a much smaller net loss. Clouds form when moisture gathers around airborne particles, such as pollen or dust. Clouds formed by the aerosol particles emitted by fossil fuel consumption are made of many more tiny droplets than \"natural\" clouds. These smog-created clouds have two notable effects: they shield sunlight from reaching Earth's surface and, due to water's reflective nature, the millions of tiny droplets suspended in them reflect light back into space, allowing even less light to reach Earth. Many scientists now believe that global dimming caused by these pollutants has mitigated the temperature rises brought about by global warming. Over the last thirty years, Earth's temperature has increased by about 0.5 oC. In the absence of global dimming, however, the Earth might be 0.3 oC warmer than it currently is, suggesting that a \"tug-of-war\" exists between greenhouse gases and particulates released by burning fossil fuels. Efforts to mitigate the human health dangers of smog have allowed more heat into our atmosphere and brought about a sharper increase in global warming. Dr. James E. Hansen, professor at Columbia University and the head of the Goddard Institute for Space Studies [1], believes  that if we continue on our current pattern, this warming could be as much as five degrees in the next thirty years and ten to fourteen degrees over the course of the century. Such a temperature rise would devastate life on Earth, likely bringing on a cascade of self-reinforcing warming effects. Earth's forests drying and burning, a steady thawing of the Greenland and arctic ice sheets, and, most dangerous of all, a release of the methane hydrates that are now frozen at the bottom of the oceans, could remake the planet into something inhospitable to human life. Dr. Hansen warns that, according to his research, man has just 10 years to reduce greenhouse gases before global warming and other responses to human activity by Earth's climate reach a \"tipping point\", becoming unstoppable. \n",

      " US, five Asian nations announce climate change partnership. The United States, China, India, Japan, South Korea, and Australia have formed a partnership aiming to cut the emissions of gasses that lead to global warming. The deal was signed after nearly a year of secret negotiations. The Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate deal does not — as yet — contain targets for reducing emissions. Environmental groups have condemned the deal, claiming that, as it is not legally binding, it is no substitute for the Kyoto Protocol, which the US and Australia refuse to sign. China and India — along with some 140 other countries — have already ratified the Kyoto agreement, but did not have to set a target for reducing gas emissions due to their status as developing countries. The Kyoto Protocol has the firm target of reducing emissions by 5.2% on 1990 levels before 2010. Answering critics, the Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer said, \"We are not trying to detract from Kyoto and the commitments that a number of countries have made under the Kyoto Protocol. This partnership will complement and not replace the Kyoto Protocol.\" The Australian Prime Minister John Howard also said that his country should not pursue renewable technologies, but should instead concentrate in reducing emissions from the use of coal. Australia is the world's largest exporter of coal, and Howard said that \"Australia [should not be] unreasonably penalising herself by saying, in effect, we're going to try to move away from the use of fuels in which Australia has a natural advantage.\" However part of the deal includes setting up a fund to further research cleaner energy technologies, including more efficient use of fossil fuels as well as renewable technologies, and also methods of trapping and storing greenhouse gasses rather than releasing them to the atmosphere. It is hoped that this will aid China, India and other developing countries to adopt cleaner energy solutions. The details will be worked out at a meeting between the six countries in November, shortly before the next UN summit on climate change. The countries believe the deal is fairer and more effective than the Kyoto Protocol. However, a Greenpeace spokesperson said, \"The suggested scheme is, unlike Kyoto, a voluntary scheme, and all evidence shows that voluntary schemes do not work. Skulking around making secretive, selective deals will not accomplish a reduction in emissions .\" The UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has warned that global temperatures could rise by 1.4C to as much as 5.8C by 2100. The US and China are the two biggest producers of carbon dioxide (a major greenhouse gas) in the world. \n",

      " Australian government commits AU$60 million to cut greenhouse emissions. In response to the Stern Report, Australia's Prime Minister John Howard announced AU$60 million to fight climate change, on 42 projects to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The projects are part of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. \"The Asia-Pacific Partnership includes countries that represent about half of the world's emissions, energy use, GDP (gross domestic product) and population, and is an important initiative that engages, for the first time, the key greenhouse-gas emitting countries in the Asia-Pacific region,\" Mr Howard said in a statement. Howard told the audience at the CSIRO's Ensis, a research and development organisation for the forestry industry, the government was taking practical steps to lower greenhouse gas emissions and symbolism would not clean up the air. \"Symbolism will not reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Practical methods will and that is what I'm interested in... The thing that matters is doing things\" he said. More than half the money is going to projects to develop clean coal technology, including $8 million for a mobile carbon catcher for coal-fired power stations. $17.5 million will be spent on renewable energy projects, including high efficiency solar power stations and solar-enhanced transport fuels. $11 million will be spent on coal mining. $6 million will be spent on improving energy efficiency of appliances and buildings, and AU$2.5 million will be used to help the aluminium industry reduce emissions. Howard dismissed as \"pure speculation\" the Stern Report's more alarmist projections. \"Talk about hot air. There's an enormous amount of hot air on this issue,\" Howard says \"what we need are measures which actually achieve results.\" and that his announcement will achieve results. \n",

      " Greenhouse-gas emission targets may come later says Ban Ki-moon. The United Nations secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon says setting greenhouse-gas emission targets may have to wait until after the U.N. Climate Change Conference being held in Bali. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-Moon told reporters it may be too \"ambitious\" to set targets for greenhouse-gas emissions in the draft text of an agreement aimed at replacing the Kyoto Protocol to stop global warming. Delegates from about 190 nations, now holding high-level meetings, are split over whether targets should be set now or later. Mr. Ban recognizes the divisions. \"Frankly speaking, realistically, it may be too ambitious if delegates would expect to be able to agree on target of greenhouse gas emission reduction,\" he said. \"But, as I told you, some time down the road we will have to agree on that.\" Ministers and heads of states, in a series of speeches, urged nations to lower greenhouse gas emissions. These gases, particularly those caused by the burning of fuels, are believed by many scientists to contribute to global warming. Leaders said rich nations should make the first cuts and help poorer nations to develop clean technology. The United States strongly opposes emission targets, as do Japan and Canada. U.S. officials say including emission targets would prejudge negotiations expected over the next two years to find a replacement for the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012. But the European Union and environmentalists say setting emission targets in the draft will show that industrialized nations are serious about the fight against global warming. The U.S. under-secretary of state for democracy and global affairs, Paula Dobriansky, who is heading the U.S. delegation to Bali, says Washington is committed to seeing an agreement reached at the Bali conference. \"We are very committed to working toward a successful outcome here in Bali. We want to launch a process that is open and does not predetermine or preclude options,\" she said. \"We have been listening carefully to the perspectives of others and will continue to do so in the days ahead. We hope to identify a way forward that will bridge our differences and bring us together on common pursuit of our shared goal of addressing climate change.\" The text of the conference draft is expected to undergo several revisions before being finalized Friday. It calls for industrialized nations to commit to cutting greenhouse gas emissions by between 25 to 40 percent by the year 2020. The Bali conference is expected to end on Friday. \n",

      " Climate Conference in Bali concluded; opinions on outcome differ. The Roadmap establishes the target year of 2009 and the scope for a post-2012 climate change agreement. This agreement is expected to include the setting, for industrialized nations, of reduction targets for greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, amongst other things. While the EU had wished for the inclusion of a guideline range of 25-40% for GHG emission cuts by industrialized nations by 2020, this had been opposed by the US and others, and so was not included in the final \"roadmap\" which addresses all nations that are part of the United Nations Framework on Climate Change Convention (UNFCCC). The range was however included in the preamble of the document agreed on by the members of the Kyoto Protocol. The \"Bali Roadmap\" document can be seen as having three distinct sections: The first is the preamble, which is non binding and is there to put the following decisions in context. This is where the guideline emissions cut range would have been. Still included is a reference to the latest report by the international body of scientists that is charged with assessing the current state of knowledge on climate change. This Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had presented its Synthesis report earlier this year. It also recognizes that \"deep cuts in global emission will be required\" to avoid dangerous climate change. The second part is composed of a section calling for a \"shared vision for long-term cooperative action, including a long-term global goal for emission reductions\" and then goes on with a description of the four \"building blocks\" envisioned for tackling climate change. These are: The third and last part is the technical part of the document, with a proposed timetable for meetings and similar procedural matters being included. But it was not just the future that was talked about. There was also consensus on a number of current issues, such as the setting up of an expanded adaptation fund, and the necessity of accelerating the transfer and development of \"climate friendly\" technology. Perspectives on the outcome varied, with some non governmental organizations (NGOs) like Greenpeace International being generally happy that an agreement was achieved, but stating that a stronger mandate for the post 2012 negotiations had been wished for, and that current issues were not all addressed satisfactorily either. The UN secretary general Ban Ki-moon on the other hand welcomed the outcome of the conference, stating that all of his three benchmarks for success had been reached. He went on to say that he \"believes that the Bali Roadmap that has been agreed is a pivotal first step toward an agreement that can address the threat of climate change, the defining challenge of our time.\" The EU also welcomed the agreement that was reached, with Commission President José Manuel Barroso noting that \"We have worked hard to achieve this result. It is a very important step forward.\" Both he and Stavros Dimas, European Commissioner for Environment, made it clear that Bali had only been the start of what needed to be done, with the later stating that \"Now the real hard work must begin. It is essential that the agreement to be worked out over the next two years is ambitious enough to prevent global warming from reaching dangerous levels.” \n",

      " Israeli greenhouses to be preserved after Gaza pullout. A last minute deal reached Saturday dictates that about 1,000 Israeli settler greenhouses located in the Gaza strip will not be dismantled after Monday's pullout.  Instead, they will remain standing and be placed in Palestinian control. The deal allows one of the Gaza strip's largest employers to remain intact.   Greenhouses in the region currently employ more than 4,000 people. The deal was pioneered by envoy James Wolfenson.  Mr. Wolfenson will purchase the greenhouses using funds amounting to US$14 million. He will proceed to turn the properties over to Palestine. Daniel Ayalon, Israeli ambassador to the United States, spoke optimistically of the greenhouse agreement.   Said Mr. Ayalon, \"As we leave Gaza, and some parts of the West Bank, we are not leaving scorched earth. On the contrary, we are leaving behind means for them to take over and immediately better their situation.\" In Gaza, the median age is 15 and about 80% of the population live in poverty. \n",

      " Climate change talks continue in Bali. The United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali is nearing its halfway mark. Senior delegates are hopeful an international agreement will be reached on how to control harmful climate emissions when the Kyoto Protocol expires in 2012, but environmental activists fear the talking is taking too long. Delegates in Bali hope to begin drafting a plan to cut greenhouse gas emissions in an effort to contain rising global temperatures. Many scientists believe the emissions contribute to a rise in global temperatures. Yvo de Boer, the United Nations' climate change chief, told reporters Friday that over the past two days, the mood at negotiations has been positive. Asked to provided a concrete example of progress, he said a special working group of delegates has agreed that any future agreement should include ways to encourage countries such as China and India to develop environmentally friendly practices as their industries and economies grow. \"So they've gone into an in-depth discussion on mitigation, and have come to the conclusion that really a strong focus needs to be on putting in place incentives for developing countries to mitigate climate change. That came up very strongly. That, to me at least, is a good indication that the mood is good, people are at work,\" said de Boer. But environmentalists have not been as optimistic about progress in this week's negotiations. Also today the Greenpeace ship the Rainbow Warrior arrived in Bali. Earlier this week, Japan took a position similar to the United States in proposing that any new agreement should favor voluntary emissions targets instead of mandatory ones. The two nations believe that binding emissions caps would threaten the economic growth needed to fund technology used to fight global warming. Hans Verlome, director of the World Wildlife Fund's Climate Change Program, urged the U.S., Japan and others to take more decisive action in light of a report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change that found global warming is occurring and is likely caused by humans. \"We did not come to Bali to just have another process, and we have two years of talks. It is time to get on with it,\" said Verlome. \"The IPCC report has delivered the results that are necessary to inform decision making, and the decision making is here, now.\" Verlome and other environmentalists say China has taken a leading role in negotiations this week. China wants wealthy countries to help spread technology for cutting greenhouse gas emissions in poor countries. Harlan Watson of the U.S. delegation reaffirmed his country's opposition to mandatory caps on carbon emissions, but said the U.S. would be open and flexible. \"The U.S. is committed to advancing negotiations, and developing a Bali roadmap, that will guide negotiations on a new post-2012 global climate change regime that is environmentally effective and economically sustainable,\" he said. Delegates are on schedule to begin drafting proposals early next week. Environment and trade ministers are scheduled to meet over the next few days. \n",

      " US Senate Panel approves bill to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. A United States Senate committee has passed landmark legislation aimed at combating global warming by limiting carbon dioxide emissions. The vote was timed to coincide with the U.N. conference on climate change taking place in Bali, Indonesia. The bill would set caps on U.S. greenhouse gas emissions from electric utility, transportation and manufacturing industries beginning in 2012 with the goal of cutting emissions 60 percent by 2050. It would create an incentive system that would give credits to industries that cut pollution. Industries that failed to reduce emissions would be forced to buy credits from others. The Democratic-led Senate Environment and Public Works Committee voted eleven to eight, largely along party lines, to send the measure to the full Senate for what supporters hope will be action early next year. \"We are facing a crisis that will hit our children and our grandchildren the hardest if we do not act now. Not to act would be wrong, cowardly, and irresponsible,\" said Senator Barbara Boxer, a Californian Democrat, chairwoman of the committee. Senator Boxer, who is expected to travel to Bali as part of a U.S. congressional delegation next week, said committee approval of the bill sends a signal to the rest of the world that the United States is serious about reducing global warming. But many Republicans oppose the legislation, saying it would increase energy costs and lead to job losses. They argue the measure does not ensure that other nations, particularly China and India, will cut emissions. \"China's emission will continue to accelerate as it builds coal plants and imports jobs from the United States. This will be enormously expensive to households within seven years as electricity prices skyrocket by 35 to 65 percent,\" said Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, the top Republican on the committee. But co-sponsor Republican Senator John Warner of Virginia, who broke with many in his party to support the measure, offered a different view: \"If we do not act, China and India will hide behind America's skirts of inaction and take no steps of their own. Therefore we simply have to lead,\" he said. The House of Representatives has yet to draft its own version of the legislation. \n",

      " UN scientist: Eat less meat to tackle climate change. Rajendra Pachauri, the chair of the UN-run Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has said that eating less meat is a good way to reduce damage to the climate. Pachuari said that \"the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) has estimated that direct emissions from meat production account for about 18% of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions,\" when explaining the reasons behind his comment. \"So I want to highlight the fact that among options for mitigating climate change, changing diets is something one should consider.\" \"In terms of immediacy of action and the feasibility of bringing about reductions in a short period of time, it [giving up meat] clearly is the most attractive opportunity,\" continued the climate scientist. \"Give up meat for one day [a week] initially, and decrease it from there.\" Joyce D'Silva, a spokesperson for Compassion in World Farming agreed with Pachuari. \"Surveys show people are anxious about their personal carbon footprints and cutting back on car journeys and so on; but they may not realize that changing what's on their plate could have an even bigger effect,\" she said in response to the comments made by the UN climate scientist. The National Farmers Union said that people should find ways of environmental farming instead of giving up meat. \"The NFU is committed to ensuring farming is part of the solution to climate change, rather than being part of the problem,\" said a spokesperson for the organization. \"We strongly support research aimed at reducing methane emissions from livestock farming by, for example, changing diets and using anaerobic digestion.\" \n",

      " \"Bali Roadmap\" agreed on, applauded. After the United States agreed to the changes proposed by India this morning, the so called Bali Roadmap has been agreed on, to applause from all parties. The decision was made at this year's United Nations Climate Change Conference in Bali. The Roadmap establishes a time frame and scope for reaching a post-2012 climate change agreement. This includes setting, for industrialized nations, targets for reductions of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Numerous observers and parties had voiced that they see this as being of great importance prior to and during the conference. Following the reopening of the plenary at midday, India reiterated its position that part of a paragraph needed to be reformulated. The EU went on to state that in the spirit of negotiations, they agreed with the proposed changes. After some further statements by other nations, the US said that they can not accept the changes, as they would considerably change the balance of the text. This was met with loudly audible booing in the plenary. Some time later, after a number of other nations voiced their opinions and the American delegation could be seen busily debating and writing, the US said they would agree to the consensus position after all. Standing ovations and cheers welcomed this change in position, which allowed the President of the Conference soon thereafter to declare the document decided. India this morning had raised objections on one of the central documents of what constitutes the Roadmap. This had made a decision impossible for the time being, as the conference can only pass items unanimously. The objection regarded the phrasing of how nations with developing industries are to take action to slow and reduce their GHG emissions. The President of the Conference, the Indonesian Environmental Minister, had declined the request, stating that the proposal he had made was very finely balanced. The President had then suspended the session so that further consultations could be made. No progress was made when the meeting was reopened about an hour later, with China stating that negotiations of the so called Group of 77 and China with the Indonesian Minister of Finance were still ongoing. China then accused the UNFCCC secretariat of deliberately opening the plenary session at a time it knew that their Ministers were in talks. The Chinese delegate went on to demand an apology by the secretariat, and the meeting was again suspended. Ministerial negotiations had continued through the night until the early morning hours yesterday and the climate conference had been scheduled to decide on the last outstanding items this morning. Yesterday evening Yvo de Boer of the UNFCCC had said that the parties were \"on the brink of agreement\", when he was asked where negotiations currently stand. With almost all open matters having been agreed on by a group of 40 ministers, one of the last outstanding points then was still the question of guideline numbers for GHG cuts. Some of the issues that had still been open the day before yesterday (for example how deforestation was to be addressed and the matter of financial support for developing countries to send and support negotiators to the UN climate conferences), had apparently been addressed to everyones satisfaction during yesterdays informal talks. But the talks were still on with regard to preambular text of a document that states how further action to mitigate climate change is to be taken, the inclusion of a 25-40% range for reductions in GHG emissions for industrialized nations by 2020 from 1990 levels being contested. The draft decision proposed by the President of the Conference today however, no longer included the numbers, but did make reference to the latest report by the international body of scientists that is charged with assessing the current state of knowledge on climate change. This Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) had presented its Synthesis report earlier this year. \n",

      " World's biggest polluters won't cut back on fossil fuel. Six of the world's major polluters, who participated in this week's Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate (AP6 or APPCDC), have launched a multi-million dollar fund to develop clean-energy, but stressed they will be heavily reliant on polluting fossil-fuels for generations to come. Green groups, labelling the talks a sham, have condemned the climate talks which were held in Sydney, Australia as a \"coal and nuclear pact\" between the big polluters and fossil-fuel firms. Australian climate change observers have attacked the AP6 outcomes as grossly irresponsible, saying the Federal Government is willing to accept the reality of runaway climate change. A communique released by the AP6 states: \"We recognise that fossil fuels underpin our economies, and will be an enduring reality for our lifetimes and beyond\" - the document said. Green groups say the pact has missed a vital opportunity to commit to renewable energy sources. They say the two-day meeting failed to make any serious commitments in combatting global warming. Combined, the United States, China, Japan, India, South Korea and Australia, account for around half the globe's greenhouse gases. The six countries set up the summit as an ulterior method of tackling global warming outside the Kyoto Protocol by, they say, focussing on \"clean-energy technology.\" Nuclear Power, clean coal technologies, geosequestration and industry-driven environment funds were some of the proposals raised at the summit. Unlike the Kyoto Protocol the six nations have not set any targets to cut greenhouse gases. Climate change observers have broadly criticised the AP6 as a waste of time. Australian Climate Institute's Clive Hamilton says the meeting did little to cut greenhouse gas emissions. \"I think really this conference is about trying to protect the long-term future of the coal industry,\" he said. \"If you look at the sort of business people who have a seat at the table at the conference in Sydney, they overwhelmingly represent the polluting industries rather than those that will at some time in the future replace them - the renewable energy and energy efficiency industries.\" CSIRO chief scientist Dr David Brockway says the technology required to reduce greenhouse emissions is not viable for industry. \"It has to be borne in mind that anything we are going to do to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and intensity from the Australian economy will come at a cost,\" he said. \"What we are doing at the moment is doing research to try and reduce the size of that additional cost. I would say in a five to 10 year timeframe a number of these technologies will become viable.\" An AP6 communique issued at the end of the conference said reductions in greenhouse gases must be achieved without hindering economic growth - \"the partnership aims to mobilise domestic and foreign investment into clean and low-emission technology by fostering the best possible enabling environments,\" it states. Some of the world's big mining and energy firms attended the talks and pledged to improve efficiency. Green groups, who were left out of the conference, say the talks were aimed at subverting Kyoto - which obligates some 40 developed countries to cut greenhouse emissions by 5 percent below 1990 levels during 2008-2012. \"Basically, they haven't agreed to do anything in terms of serious commitment,\" said Monash University climate change expert Professor Amanda Lynch. The United States and Australia refuse to sign Kyoto claiming its mandatory greenhouse gas cuts would threaten economic growth. Australian Prime Minister John Howard said, \"experience has taught us that seeking arbitrary targets doesn't result in achieving practical solutions to global climate change.\" Mr Howard stressed the importance of maintaining economic growth to alleviate poverty, while cutting greenhouse emissions. He said the summit had injected \"an overdue dose of realism into the debate about climate change. We believe it is possible to tackle issues of greenhouse gas emissions and the challenge of climate change without reducing living standards,\" he said. \"The world will go on using fossil fuels for many years into the future because it's more economic to do so. So therefore it's elementary commonsense that you should try and make the use of fossil fuels more greenhouse gas sensitive, you should try and clean up the use of fossil fuel,\" he said. The World Wildlife Fund (WWF) have dismissed Mr Howard's comments as misleading and irresponsible. The WWF's chief executive Greg Bourne said, \"in my whole business career, I have never seen a more misleading public statement as that... If the statements made today become a reality, this will lock us in to a four-degree rise in global average temperatures, when two-degrees is considered extremely dangerous,\" he said. \"There couldn't be anything more irresponsible than to knowingly embark on a path towards massive increases in emissions and runaway global warming.\" The AP6 nations said in the final communique that the eight public/private partnership taskforces created at the conference, will draw up action plans by the middle of 2006 on issues including renewable energy, power generation, cleaner fossil fuels and coal mining. Environmentalists said the Sydney pact was doomed to fail because it did not impose targets on its members which comprise nearly half of humanity. The New South Wales Nature Conservation Council said the group's voluntary approach was a \"licence for government and business to do nothing\". \"Without any incentives or penalties there is no reason for industry to move away from burning polluting coal and oil,\" said the council's Cate Faehrmann. The AP6 countries encompass: 49 per cent of world GDP; 48 per cent of the world energy consumption; 48 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions; and 45 per cent of the world's population. Many scientists say global warming is melting glaciers, raising sea levels and will cause more intense storms, droughts and floods. Current levels of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere are higher now than at any time in the past 650,000 years, research from Antarctic ice cores shows. \n",

      " U.S. Supreme Court overturns Arthur Andersen conviction. The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday overturned a witness tampering conviction against accounting firm Arthur Andersen LLP for destroying documents related to now-bankrupt energy giant Enron Corp.  The verdict virtually put Andersen, once one of the largest accounting firms in the world and the fifth-largest in the United States, out of business. In a unanimous opinion written by Chief Justice William Rehnquist, the court threw out the verdict due to serious flaws in the jury instructions.  The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals had upheld Andersen's June 15, 2002 conviction in Houston. In the court's view, the instructions allowed the jury to convict Andersen without proving that the firm knew it broke the law or that there was a link to any official proceeding that prohibited the destruction of documents.   \"The jury instructions at issue simply failed to convey the requisite consciousness of wrongdoing,\" Rehnquist wrote. \"Indeed, it is striking how little culpability the instructions required.\"  Rehnquist's opinion also expressed grave skepticism at the government's definition of \"corrupt persuasion\" — persuasion with an improper purpose even without knowing an act is unlawful.  \"Only persons conscious of wrongdoing can be said to 'knowingly corruptly persuade,' \" he wrote. The ruling came very quickly, as oral arguments in the case had taken place on April 27. Justice Department attorneys claimed Andersen employees were instructed \"undertake an unprecedented campaign of document destruction\" in order to impede a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation into Enron's conduct.  Deputy Solicitor General David Dreeben likened Andersen's behavior to \"shredding its smoking guns.\" However, Maureen Mahoney, arguing for Andersen, countered that the employees involved merely followed the company's policy on destroying unneeded documents, and that the shredding occurred before Andersen received a subpoena on November 8, 2001.   She also claimed that under the government's legal definition of \"corrupt persuasion,\" acquittal was virtually impossible. The justices seemed to indicate which way they were leaning very early in oral arguments, as they peppered the government lawyers with hostile remarks. Justice Antonin Scalia called the government's theory of prosecution \"weird.\"  Justice Sandra Day O'Connor was particularly troubled by the trouble the jury initially had sifting the evidence.  \"If this thing is so confusing,\" she asked, \"how is a businessperson supposed to know?  How is a lawyer supposed to know?\" Andersen's appeal was backed by the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers.   In a friend-of-the-court brief, the association claimed that the government's broad definition of \"corrupt persuasion\" put defense lawyers at risk for prosecution simply for advising clients of their rights to assert legal privileges or review document retention policies. Despite the ruling, which returns the case to the Fifth Circuit, it is highly unlikely Andersen will ever return as a viable business.  It lost nearly all of its clients after its indictment, and was forced to shut down its American accounting practice due to federal laws that forbid convicted felons from auditing public companies.  The firm still faces more than 100 civil suits related to its audits of Enron and other companies.  Once 28,000 employees strong, the Chicago-based Andersen is now down to around 200 employees who are largely occupied with handling the civil suits and other details of winding down the partnership. \n",

      " Global warming underestimated, say scientists. Some scientists say current climate change estimates may be significantly underestimating the potential scale of global warming. The team of researchers report that the actual warming due to human fossil fuel emissions could be 15 percent to 78 percent higher than estimates that fail to take into account the feedback mechanism which involves carbon dioxide and Earth temperature. Greenhouse gases are believed to contribute to global warming, yet scientists have said that global warming itself triggers greenhouse gas emissions - meaning that the Earth may get hotter faster than climate models predict. Another team of researchers in California, has reported a similar conclusion: \"when the Earth has warmed up in the past, due to the sun's natural cycles, more greenhouse gases have been spewed into the atmosphere. As greenhouse gas levels rose, so did the Earth's temperature,\" the scientists reported. Dr Margaret Torn of Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory said: \"It means the warming is happening faster, each decade is actually warming faster than it would have,\" Dr Torn said. \"It's the pace of change that will be one of the big problems. It's how humans adapt and the cost that will depend on the rate of change of climate.\" Over the past 30 years, the Earth has warmed by 0.6 degrees Celsius, NASA has reported. Over the past 100 years, it has warmed by 0.8 degrees C, indicating a recent acceleration in warmth. Current climate models predict temperature increases of 1.5 to 4.5 degrees Celsius, but the California team realised that additional carbon dioxide caused by the natural solar cycle may elevate these estimates. Taking this information on board could mean temperature increases of 1.6 to 6 degrees Celsius - and the higher temperatures are more likely, they said in a statement. Meanwhile, another group of leading US scientists has linked global warming to the recent increase in hurricane intensity. They warn that humans must develop cleaner energy and transportation immediately - or bear the risk of more extreme storms. \"One is faced with repeating history, of putting up with $200 billion worth of damage every so often,\" said Dr. Peter Webster, a professor at the Georgia Institute of Technology and author of a 2005 study that found the strength and duration of hurricanes has doubled in the last 50 years. \"I’m not sure how many $200 billion the country can afford,\" he told journalists. Lawrence Berkeley's Dr Torn said humans are the biggest unknown: \"To predict the future, you have to guess how much CO2 levels will go up. That depends on the biggest uncertainty of all - what humans decide to do. Do we get smart and prevent CO2 emissions? Do we continue with business as usual? Or will we end up somewhere in between?\" \n",

      " EU may see no reason to go to next major emitters meeting. Stavros Dimas at a press conference today stated that the European Union would not view it as necessary to attend the major emitters meeting (MEM) if no substantial agreement was reached at the climate change conference in Bali. His statement was made after being asked about rumours of the EU boycotting the US held MEM. He said that he had mentioned the preceding point of view in the presence of an under-secretary of the US government at a business breakfast this morning. He answered to a later question that he felt disappointed at the current stance of the US government, and wished clarity for the moment. According to a press release by Greenpeace, the German environmental minister Sigmar Gabriel also declared to the press that the EU would not be taking part in the scheduled MEM in January if substantial progress was not made. Amongst other points that are currently being discussed, one which is often referred to is that of whether or not a guideline frame for emissions reductions is to be included in the preamble of one of the final documents. The proposed frame is 25-40% cuts in greenhouse gas emissions for industrialized nations (known as Annex I nations in UNFCCC parlance), from 1990 baselines. The US is amongst the relatively small number of nations, including Canada and Japan, that are opposed to this. Asked what he knew of the matter at an earlier press conference, Yvo de Boer of the UNFCCC stated that Stavros Dimas, the European Commissioner for the Environment, had voiced his opinion that if no agreement is reached now, than there would be no need for the Major Emitting nations meeting to be held, because, so he apparently stated, the MEM is meant to feed into the UN process, and you could not feed something into nothing. The talks being held in Bali are expected to lead to a roadmap for negotiations on greenhouse gas emissions caps for after 2012, which is when the current first phase of the Kyoto protocol is going to run out. Multiple parties, observers, and the top UN executive of the Climate Change branch all had expressed their hope that this roadmap would also include a target date of 2009 for the conclusion of negotiations. The major emitters meeting is a convention of those nations that have the greatest greenhouse gas emissions, and was held for the first time at the invitation of the US in Autumn this year. \n",

      " Copenhagen climate conference opens. The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP15) has opened on Monday with calls for urgent action to curb climate change and global warming. The largest climate conference in history at the Bella Center in Copenhagen, Denmark is running for two-weeks from December 7 until December 18. Around 15,000 delegates including representatives from the private sector, environmental organizations, research institutions and government officials, as well as 110 heads of state and government from 192 countries, will attend. The COP15 Cultural Opening Ceremony played a four-minute long film called Please help the world by the Danish director Mikkel Blaabjerg Poulsen to highlight the danger of rising temperatures. The film depicts a young girl’s screaming nightmare about an eco-apocalypse with global warming, desert wastelands and terrifying floods. As the girl wakes from the nightmare she and other children implores us to 'Please help the world'. Poulsen said, “We have made a film which speaks to the heart rather than to the brain”. There was also music from a trumpeter, a harpist and the Danish National Girls Choir. The UN climate change conference, the climax of two years of contentious negotiations, opened in an atmosphere of hope. There was an upbeat mood for a deal to be reached within the next two weeks.   At a press briefing,  Connie Hedegaard, the president of the conference, said that “the deadline is working”, but “within the time we have, we must solve the task”. Lars Lokke Rasmussen stressed, however, that the talks will have to overcome the deep distrust between rich and poor nations on how to share the burden of curbing emissions. There has been a series of promises by rich and emerging economies to curb their greenhouse gases, but there are major issues yet to be resolved.  UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said that a legally binding treaty on climate change will be reached in 2010. The European Union has adopted a commitment to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions by 20 percent by 2020 compared to 1990 levels but the union will raise its commitments to 30% if other major players undertake “comparable commitments”. News that the United States Environmental Protection Agency ruled that greenhouse gases endanger human health  may allow reductions of U.S greenhouse gas emissions. Quoting an unnamed diplomatic source, the Financial Times Deutschland has said the EU is to provide “1-3 billion euro” in aid to developing countries over the next three years so they can fight the effects of climate change and allow climate change mitigation and adaptation. The conference was accused of environmental hypocrisy for its substantial carbon footprint, including its extensive use of private jets and limousines. To reduce the conference's environmental and climate impact, the Danish government will not give gifts to participants. The money will be spent on climate scholarships called COP15 Climate Scholarships, allowing 10-12 candidates to carry out 2-year climate related master’s programmes at Danish universities. Thousands of people are outside the conference building including groups such as Climate Justice Action, Friends of the Earth, Camp for Climate Action, 350.org and Greenpeace calling for urgent action. The environmental group Friends of the Earth condemned what it called “undemocratic practices adopted by the Danish presidency of convening small and exclusive groups of countries before the Copenhagen meeting”. A draft negotiating text has been publicly released, but it is rumored that there is an “alternate” treaty document being developed by some large countries in the negotiations, including conference organizers. According to the Bali Road Map,  the 15th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP15) and the 5th Meeting of the Parties to the Kyoto Protocol (COP/MOP5) must agree to a framework for climate change mitigation beyond 2012. Heads of states and governments of 110 countries have announced that they will come to Copenhagen before the 18th of December in an attempt to seal a political global climate deal. If a deal is reached, the UN will aim at transforming it into a legally binding text to replace the Kyoto Protocol, as its regulations of emissions expire in 2012. \n",

      " Post-Kyoto agreement is subject of G8 debate. Leaders from the 7 richest industrialised countries and Russia will have to deal with climate issues at the 33rd G8 summit in Heiligendamm, Germany. While France and Germany are calling for quantifiable greenhouse gas emission cuts, the U.S. and Japan believe that growing economies such as India and China would need to join in on such efforts. German Chancellor Angela Merkel at the G8 summit yesterday said the two main topics were climate change and combating poverty in Africa. She said her first talks with president Bush were good, and added: \"I trust that we will work out joint positions on that.\" Bush acknowledged that he has \"strong desire to work ... on a post-Kyoto agreement.\" Merkel had proposed a 50% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 compared to  1990 levels, helping to keep global temperature rise to no more than 3.6°C. White House adviser James Connaughton however said that \"At this point in time we are not prepared to adopt that proposal.\" President George W. Bush finds himself in a position between the pressure from France and Germany, but on the other hand he wants to urge countries like India and China to join climate efforts. He told reporters that: \"The United States can serve as a bridge between some nations who believe that now is the time to come up with a set goal … and those who are reluctant to participate in the dialogue. ... We all can make major strides, and yet there won't be a reduction until China and India are participants.\" President Bush will defend his plan today to organise a separate conference on global warming with the 15 biggest polluters to set their own goals, and to rely on technological innovations to achieve part of the emission targets. When asked about the U.S. plans, Merkel said in a television interview that she didn't expect the differences to disappear overnight. At the G8 summit she said stated: \"I think we all know that the goals agreed by the European Union cannot be accepted by the entire world.\" Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe told reporters: \"On climate change ... We agreed that Japan and the United States would be working together for the creation of an effective framework which is flexible, and that we would be cooperating to achieve that end in the future.\" The new President of France Nicolas Sarkozy wants the U.S. to increase their efforts on climate issues. He told reporters yesterday: \"We need quantifiable targets in the final text. It is an extremely important point and I intend to talk to the president of the United States about it as early as this evening. ... President Bush has made a first effort, but we need to set ourselves targets to clearly show the determination of the G-8 to act and to obtain results...  If we don't act now, it will be too late to avoid a disaster. It will cost less than if we wait.\" A spokesman for Russian President Vladimir Putin called the U.S. plans to deal with global warming \"very pragmatic and interesting.\" Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi recognised that \"the American president has made comments in the last few days that have been more open than in the past.\" Prime Minister of the United Kingdom Tony Blair also welcomed the U.S. engagement for \"substantial\" reductions, which the U.S. is aiming for, according to a recent U.S. draft G8 document. President of the European Commission José Manuel Barroso at the G8 summit said he thought the E.U. was taking a leading role in the climate debate, also by influencing the position of countries like the U.S. and China. He believes a global agreement to follow Kyoto is needed, possibly by 2009. He stressed that, as this was a problem created by all nations, effecting all, it had to be tackled within the UN-framework, and that agreements made by only a number of states would fall short of what is needed. He also doubted the possibility that hard numbers on emissions cuts would result from this summit. Other topics at the G8 Summit will be development in Africa (including the fight against AIDS and  malaria), the Doha Round of the World Trade Organization, and the U.S. plans to set up a missile defence shield in Europe. The U.S. is the only G8 country that has not ratified the Kyoto protocol, which expires in 2012. \n",

      " APEC countries set \"aspirational goals\" on climate change. Australian Prime Minister John Howard has announced that leaders of APEC nations have agreed on \"aspirational goals\" on climate change. The agreement, which Prime Minister Howard calls the Sydney declaration focuses on reducing energy intensity (the amount of energy used to produce a dollar of gross domestic product), reforestation and technology sharing. Despite Australia, the United States and China being non-signatories to the United Nations' Kyoto protocol on greenhouse gas reductions which is set to expire in 2012, the APEC accord calls for \"We call for a post-2012 international climate change arrangement ... that strengthens, broadens and deepens the current arrangement and leads to reduced global emissions of greenhouse gases,\" according to the draft declaration. The declaration as agreed upon will be released on Sunday. The draft agreement recognised that action was required to \"slow, stop and reverse\" greenhouse gas emissions; that nations should vow to reduce energy intensity by 25 percent by 2030; that forest cover in the region should be increased by 50 million acres by 2020; and that APEC nations will work with other nations to find a solution to climate change. The declaration is non-binding and is simply a statement of goals to which the nations will try to achieve. Host nation Australia has been criticised by China, Indonesia, Japan and Malaysia for putting climate change on the agenda at the APEC summit, saying they would prefer dialogue on climate change to occur under a United Nationa framework. Indonesia's Foreign Minister Hassan Wirayuda said \"the APEC meeting does not replace the appropriate forum to deal with climate change.\" Mr Wiraydua said that despite Indonesia not being entirely satisfied with the declaration they would \"live with it\". Environmental group Greenpeace has rejected the APEC statement because it doesn't set firm targets and includes the use of nuclear energy as a replacement for fossil fuels. \n",

      " USA under pressure at climate talks. The European Union, Canada, Indonesia and other nations at the United Nations' climate talks in Montreal have put pressure on the United States. Participants at the meeting want the US to join the global Kyoto pact to limit greenhouse gas emissions, to curb extreme weather predictions from global warming. Environment ministers from over 90 countries are meeting to break a deadlock over how to entice the United States, and other large developing nations such as India and China, to cut production of greenhouse gases. Washington has rejected the pact, saying mandatory emissions cuts would harm its economy. The United States defended its policy of investing billions of dollars in cleaner technology to reduce emissions, brushing aside calls for it to commit to U.N. discussions on slowing climate change. At the heart of the Montreal meeting is how to cut emissions after 2012, when the first phase of the Kyoto Protocol climate change pact ends. \n",

      " Australian government says technology could reduce emissions three times more than Kyoto. Less than one week out from the inaugural Asia-Pacific Clean Development and Climate Partnership meeting in Sydney, the Australian government has claimed that technology could be used to cut emissions three times more than the Kyoto Protocol. Ian Macfarlane, Minister for Industry said that the six countries at next week's meeting will discuss ways to cut greenhouse gas emissions while continuing to produce large amounts of energy. \"While Kyoto puddles on, to put it nicely, the real reductions will come from technology\" Mr Macfarlane said. \"This is not a diplomatic love-in. It's a hard-edged business plan with targets and reporting duties.\" The members of the partnership - Australia, the United States, China, India, Japan and South Korea produce around half of the world's greenhouse gas emissions. Of the world's developed nations only Australia and the United States have refused to ratify Kyoto. The pact will not set binding targets upon its members, but will monitor its results. It is believed that the meeting will discuss nuclear energy generation, geothermal energy and capturing and storing gases underground. The federal opposition is calling on the Australian government to ratify Kyoto. Environment spokesman, Anthony Albanese, said \"The Kyoto Protocol is the main game, with mandatory fixed targets for greenhouse gas emission reductions over an extended timetable, with economic instruments driving the policy outcomes\". \n",

      " EPA proposes using Clean Air Act to fight global warming. Washington, D.C. - The Environmental Protection Agency may have a new tool in its arsenal to fight global warming. The agency has submitted a proposal to the Obama administration which aims to list carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses as pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The policy had previously been proposed to and rejected by the Bush administration, which said it was the wrong tool to be using. The proposal lists the negative effects of global warming, including longer and hotter heat waves, increased flooding, and the increased spread of diseases due to warmer weather. EPA administrator Lisa Jackson has previously suggested declaring global warming a health threat, and that the agency could use the 1970 Clean Air Act to use to combat it. Environmental groups applauded the finding, with the director of Clean Air Watch, Frank O'Donnell, calling it \"a green-letter day for the environment.\" One of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce vice presidents, William L. Kovacs, said if the the proposal is put into effect that it \"will be devastating to the economy.\" It is unclear whether the Obama administration will go along with the proposal. White House spokesman Ben LaBolt commented that \"The president has made clear that to combat climate change, his strong preference is for Congress to pass energy security legislation that includes a cap on greenhouse gas emissions.\" No specific timeline has been given for when a decision would be made. An upcoming conference in Copenhagen, Denmark will focus on drawing up a new international global warming treaty, which the United States plans to attend, a clear reversal from the Bush administration's non-participation in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol. \n",

      " Glasgow Climate Pact deal struck; nations to reduce coal usage. The 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (often abbreviated to COP26) has concluded with the signing of the Glasgow Climate Pact. The pact is the first ever deal struck to explicitly plan to reduce coal usage internationally. Coal accounts for around 40% of the world's annual greenhouse gas emissions and is the highest-emitting fossil fuel in terms of greenhouse gases. However, BBC News reported that the pledges made still don't go far enough to limit global warming's impact to 1.5 degrees Celsius. According to a 2018 Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C, the differences between 1.5 and 2 degrees Celsius are profound. While 1.5 degrees would help mitigate the worst effects, even 2 degrees Celsius would exacerbate the impacts of climate change internationally. Though it was initially planned for coal to be entirely phased out, India's climate minister, Bhupender Yadav, pointed out that this would not be possible for developing nations where they \"have still to deal with their development agendas and poverty eradication\". This point refocused the discussion to reduction rather than total elimination at this stage. COP26 President Alok Sharma said that he was \"deeply sorry\" for the softening of the pact, stating that it was necessary in order to preserve the deal as a whole. Switzerland's environment minister, Simonetta Sommaruga, expressed her \"profound disappointment\", commenting that it will \"not bring us closer to 1.5C, but make it more difficult to reach it.\" \n",

      " Delhi earns UN carbon credits. The UN has certified that the Delhi Metro has aided in the reduction of greenhouse gases, earning 'carbon credits'.  This makes the Delhi Metro the first of its kind in the world to do so. This comes under the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) of the UN under the Kyoto Protocol. The UN said the rail based system has helped to save 630,000 tonnes of pollution a year. The credits to the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) are worth $9.5 million for each of the next seven years.   More credits would be given for more passengers on the system. The credits are designed as a financial incentive for developing countries to reduce greenhouse emissions. The Delhi Metro was started in 2002. According to the DMRC, it has reduced road traffic by more than 91,000 vehicles per day. \n",

      " Polar bears deliver environmental petition to Premier of British Columbia. On Thursday in Canada, the Society Promoting Environmental Conservation (SPEC) and the Western Canada Wilderness Committee delivered petitions with over 10,000 signatorys to the Premier of British Columbia's office. The petitions ask that the government cancel the Gateway Program's highway expansions components and invest more in transit instead. The Gateway Program is a transportation infrastructure project that includes over 260 km of new highway lanes. Over a dozen activists rallied outside the office in downtown Vancouver including two dressed as polar bears. The premier's office initially declined to accept the invitations. After the activists attempted to enter the nearby convention centre where the premier was speaking, staff working with the Premier agreed to accept the petitions. \"Translink is currently exhausting its capital reserves just to keep existing service going,\" said Karen Wristen, Executive Director of SPEC. \"At this rate, they will be broke in two years. We simply can't afford both freeway expansion and transit development: we have to solve the transit crisis first.\" \"It will be virtually impossible to reach BC's commitments to reduce greenhouse gases (GHGs) if Gateway is allowed to proceed. Gateway is not just an irresponsible plan, it's immoral,\" said Ben West, the Wilderness Committee's Healthy Communities Campaigner. The government calculates that greenhouse gas emissions will increase by over 170,000 tonnes per year from the Gateway program. Premier Gordon Campbell has not yet responded directly to the petition. In recent interviews he has defended the Gateway Program. \"I understand that some people will disagree with it,\" Premier Campbell said of Gateway on April 6 to The Georgia Straight. \"But it's many, many things that are happening at once to make the region more livable, to reduce our impact and our greenhouse-gas impact, and to invest in public transit. And I think that when you take all those things together—as we move to California tailpipe emissions and those other initiatives—I think you will see actually a reduction in greenhouse gases.\" This article is based on 10,000 people (and two polar bears) Petition Premier by B5baxter  which has a copyright policy compatible with our CC-BY 2.5.

      " Climate change a factor in Australia's warmest year on record. Climatologists believe artificially induced climate change is the reason Australia is destined for the warmest year on record. Temperatures so far this year have averaged one degree above the 30-year average, the Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) told the Greenhouse 2005 – Action in Climate Change Conference being held in Melbourne this week. The head of the National Climate Centre, Michael Coughlan, says Australia has had the warmest ever first 10 months of 2005, and seems likely to be a record-breaking year. \"It's typically been a degree or more above the average for most of the months,\" said Mr Coughlan. \"When you think you're averaging over hundreds of stations across Australia, to get a one degree warming over such a large area is fairly significant.\" According to BOM, Australia has experienced its warmest start to a year on record (since 1950), with the January to October temperature averaging 1.03 degrees Celsius above the 30 year average (1961-1990). Annual mean temperatures have increased throughout Australia since 1910, particularly since the 1950s. \"If one draws a trend line from the mid-50s or early 50s, through to the present, it's a fairly steady upward trend. And it's interesting that this is not true only of Australia, but it's fairly typical throughout most continents now, most parts of the world,\" said Mr Coughlan. As the average temperature has risen, there has been an increase in the incidence of hot days and hot nights, and a reduction in the number of cold days and nights. This warming is mirrored in the oceans around Australia. Michael Coughlan says warm sea surfaces are a significant factor in the creation of cyclones and hurricanes. \"One might expect, with those sea temperatures being warmer than they have been in the last few years, that the odds would be tipped towards perhaps a greater number of the cyclones than we have seen in the last few years,\" he says. Warming is not the only sign of change in Australia’s climate. Other changes include a marked decline in rainfall in southwest and parts of southeast Australia, and recent reduction in rainfall through the eastern states. At the same time, rainfall in the arid interior and northwest has increased dramatically, in some places nearly doubling during the last 50-years. \"Climate change affecting Australia is real,\" says CSIRO's Dr Bryson Bates. \"In 2005 the questions we face are how best to respond and adapt – from projections in agriculture to changing ecosystems, reduced catchment flows and downward rainfall trends,\" Dr Bates says. The GREENHOUSE 2005 Action on Climate Change Conference is expected to attract 400 Australian and international delegates. \n",

      " Wikinews' overview of the year 2007. What would you tell your grandchildren about 2007 if they asked you about it in, let's say, 20 year's time? If the answer to a quiz question was 2007, what would the question be? The year that you first signed on to Facebook? The year Britney Spears and Amy Winehouse fell apart? The year author Kurt Vonnegut or mime Marcel Marceau died, both at 84? Let's take a look at some of the international stories of 2007. Links to the original Wikinews articles are in bold. Madeleine McCann (3) disappeared on May 3 in Praia da Luz, Portugal. Initially, a local man called Robert Murat was mentioned as a suspect, although on August 7,  Kate and Gerry McCann became suspects based on forensic evidence. On April 16, 33 dead, 15 injured in Virginia Tech shootings: A single gunman entered the campus and opened fire on students and faculty in two separate incidents, first in the West Ambler Johnston Hall dormitory, then again two hours later at the Norris Hall classroom building, killing 33 people, including himself. It became the deadliest school shooting in U.S. history. The shooter was identified as Cho Seung-Hui, a 23-year old South Korean national. He was studying English and lived on the university campus. Between the two shootings, Cho sent a mail package to NBC News with his manifesto, pictures and videos. In early September, adventurer Steve Fossett went missing. Fossett reportedly took off in a single engine plane to look for a suitable site in the Nevada playas for his planned land speed record attempt. His former crewmate and rival, Sir Richard Branson remained confident he would be found: \"Steve is a tough old boot. I suspect he is waiting by his plane right now for someone to pick him up.\" On October 12, The 2007 Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to former U.S. Vice President Al Gore and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC). The Nobel committee cited \"for their efforts to build up and disseminate greater knowledge about man-made climate change, and to lay the foundations for the measures that are needed to counteract such change\" as the reasons for awarding the prize. In late October, 1,000,000 fled their homes in California due to wildfires strengthened by the Santa Ana Winds. A state of emergency was declared by President Bush and California governor Arnold Schwarzenegger. At a last-minute FEMA press conference with regards to the wildfires, FEMA employees posed as reporters asking what were regarded as overly friendly questions. Many banks in the USA saw their share prices falling after people were found to be unable to pay back many of their mortgages. The mortgages lent to people who may not be able to afford to pay back their loans are known as subprime mortgages. This spread across the stock markets internationally and UK bank Northern Rock had thousands of people queuing outside their bank after they borrowed money from the Bank of England, which is known as \"the lender of last resort.\" On January 10, 21,500 more troops to bring Operation Law and Order to Baghdad was made public. The U.S. forces began to collaborate more intensely with Iraqi troops. On February 21, the UK and Denmark announced troop withdrawals from Iraq. \"The next chapter in Basra’s history can be written by Iraqis,\" said Tony Blair. Following a reduction in violence and troop deaths in the second half of 2007, the U.S. announced troop reductions in November. Meanwhile, Turkey said it would use military action against PKK rebels attacking the country from neighboring Iraq, which the U.S. pledged support for and \"hoped to avoid\". (Image missing from Commons: image; log)] ] Vladimir Putin was named \"man of the year\" by Time Magazine. He would finish his 2nd and last term as President in 2008, although he said he would accept to subsequently become Prime Minister. Under Putin, Russia strove to increase its position as a geopolitical superpower, for example by claiming the North Pole. During 2007 former chess grandmaster Gary Kasparov, now a political activist, drew the attention of the international media. Boris Yeltsin, former president of Russia, died at 76 on April 23. Boris Nikolayevich Yeltsin (Russian: Бори́с Никола́евич Е́льцин) was the first President of the Russian Federation from 1991 to 1999. The Yeltsin era was a traumatic period in Russian history— marked by widespread corruption, economic collapse, and enormous political and social problems. Yeltsin maintained a low profile since his resignation, making almost no public statements or appearances. However, on February 1, 2006, Yeltsin celebrated his 75th birthday. He used this occasion as an opportunity to criticize a \"monopolistic\" United States foreign policy, and to state that Vladimir Putin was the right choice for Russia. More British troops were sent into Afghanistan, where the war that started after the 9/11 attacks continued with a large number of news events. In late August, it was reported that opium production in Afghanistan reached record highs. Australian David Hicks would become the first Guantánamo Bay prisoner to be sentenced, after which he returned to an Australian prison to serve out his time and was released on December 29. May 6: Sarkozy wins 2007 French Presidential election, defeating Ségolène Royal. Both separated from their partners afterwards. Sarko's style and self proclaimed openness is proved different from his predecessor Jacques Chirac. His confrontation with the unions came in the second half of November. On October 30, the French NGO Zoe's Ark was accused of trying to kidnap hundreds of Chadian children they described as Darfur orphans -Sarkozy travelled to Chad to hold talks with local officials. After a previous attack in October and house arrest, former Pakistan Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto was killed in a suicide attack on 27th December, when an attacker fired 2 gun shots at her then exploded a bomb. This assassination occurred just weeks after Musharraf lifted the state of emergency that he had instated in November in his country. Her son and husband assumed her place at the top of the Pakistan People's Party. In March, Musharraf sacked Chief Justice Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, but he was reinstated in July. On March 23, Iran captured 15 members of the British Navy and held them for alleged espionage. Mahmoud Ahmadinejad pardoned them after 12 days, saying: While the President of Iran was in New York City for the United Nations General Assembly in September, he was invited to a controversial debate at Columbia University. When challenged by the University President about Iran's treatment of LGBT's, Ahmadinejad stated that: \"In Iran we don't have homosexuals like in your country,\" drawing laughter from the audience. \"In Iran we do not have this phenomenon, I don't know who has told you that we have it.\" On January 19, Turkish-Armenian journalist Hrant Dink was assassinated in front of the Agos newspaper office where he worked as the editor. Dink was known for writing about the controversial issue of Armenian genocide and the mass killings of Armenians by Turks under the rule of the Ottoman Empire. His assassin was then treated by some Turkish security troops as a \"national hero\". In April and May, several large protests were held across the country by pro-secular Turks, out of fear that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan would run for President, then due to concerns about Presidential Candidate Abdullah Gül, whose wife wears the islamic headscarf. Gül was not appointed in the first parliamentary round, when opposition lawmakers boycotted the vote. The opposition also appealed to the Constitutional Court to declare the process unlawful. General elections followed and Gül became President on August 28. In Myanmar (formerly Burma) government forces arrested hundreds of monks in September after several days of peaceful demonstrations, but despite the violent treatment from military personnel, the monks returned to the streets. Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downer, had called \"the continued detention of Daw Aung San Suu Kyi and over one thousand political prisoners\" unacceptable. Pro-democracy leaders were arrested and a death toll of more than 1000 was reported. In late October, Myanmar opposition leader and 1991 Nobel Peace Prize laureate, Aung San Suu Kyi left her house arrest to meet with government official. On June 24 this year Gordon Brown took over from Tony Blair as leader of the UK labour party and therefore Prime Minister after a long period of time where reporters were predicting the date of Blair's departure. After this the UK was hit by its worst floods in 50 years. In late November, two computer disks were lost containing the entire Child Benefit database, estimated to contain the names, addresses, dates of birth, child benefit and National Insurance numbers, and sometimes the bank or building society account details of 25 million individuals, in what has been described as \"one of the world’s biggest ID protection failures\". Ian \"Dr. No\" Paisley and former IRA commander Martin McGuinness agreed to share power and have home rule return to Northern Ireland after four years of central rule from London. \"I believe we're starting on a road which will bring us back to peace and to prosperity,\" said Paisley, who took the post of First Minister of Northern Ireland. Just one day after a car bomb was defused in central London on June 29, a Jeep was driven into the Glasgow International Airport terminal and burst into flames in an unsuccessful terrorist attack. Several people aided the police in detaining the assailants, including baggage handler John Smeaton who received the Queen's Gallantry Medal for his actions. On December 3, Kevin Rudd was sworn in as Prime Minister of Australia after John Howard and the Liberal Party and Coalition were defeated in the election. After the ceremony, Mr. Rudd signed documents to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate change calling it the first official act of the new Australian government. A post-Kyoto agreement on climate change and combating poverty in Africa were the main topics at the summit of the 7 richest industrialised countries and Russia in Heiligendamm in June. While France and Germany were calling for quantifiable greenhouse gas emission cuts, the U.S. and Japan believed that growing economies such as India and China would need to join in on such efforts. Advocacy groups were critical about the aid promised to Africa: \"Do they think we can’t read or count?\" asked musician/activist Bono. \"We are looking for accountable language and accountable numbers: we didn’t get them today.\" The G8 Summit was preceded by mass demonstrations, such as the one in Rostock, where several hundred protesters were arrested. Eight people were killed in a school shooting in Jokela, Finland. The shooter, an 18-year-old male student named as Pekka-Eric Auvinen, was arrested after a siege situation, but died due to a gunshot wound from an apparent suicide attempt. The killer had uploaded a home-made movie to YouTube announcing the \"massacre\" one day prior to the shooting. His profile featured several movies regarding an ongoing depression and unsuccessful treatment with SSRIs. Additionally, some movies of him shooting his new gun had been uploaded weeks prior to the shooting. Auvinen also had a personal website which featured images, music and documents, including a manifesto. After the incident, Finland considered toughening gun legislation. Until then, Finland had actively resisted plans for all European Union member states to limit gun ownership to persons aged 18 and over. The law stipulated that Finns could apply for a gun permit at the age of 15. Cristina Kirchner was the favourite candidate to succeed her husband as President. Néstor Kirchner decided not to run for a second four-year term, without giving an explanation. Mrs Kirchner consistently used her first name during her electoral campaign, which is a similarity to United States presidential candidate Hilary Clinton. However Cristina told the media: \"I don't want to be compared with Hillary Clinton or with Evita Perón, or with anybody... There's nothing better than being yourself.\" The two-week long U.N. climate conference in Bali ended with an agreement on the so-called Bali roadmap, which was welcomed with cautious optimism. The roadmap details the process for a post-2012 climate change agreement. European Union Commission President José Manuel Barroso stated: \"We have worked hard to achieve this result. It is a very important step forward.\" The European Commissioner for Environment made it clear that Bali had only been the start of things: \"Now the real hard work must begin. It is essential that the agreement to be worked out over the next two years is ambitious enough to prevent global warming from reaching dangerous levels.” More than half of the year in Belgium focused on politics, as the general elections on June 10 promised some difficult coalition talks. PM Verhofstadt recognised his defeat by Christian-Democrat Yves Leterme of Flanders, while the liberals broke the socialist hegemony in Wallonia. Orange-blue coalition talks failed to produce a government for 192 days, when it was Verhofstadt who gathered consensus for an interim government. Earlier in the year, Belgium's first black city registrar organised a mass wedding against racism that caught international media attention. The RCMP, received a negative spotlight in 2007, particularly for their handling of a distraught passenger at Vancouver International Airport in November. Robert Dziekanski, 40, was immigrating from Pieszyce, Poland to live with his mother, Zofia Cisowski, in Kamloops, British Columbia. Since Dziekanski did not speak English airport security guards were unable to properly communicate with him. He started yelling at the airport staff because of this. He used chairs to prop open a door between a customs clearing area and a public lounge, he then threw a computer and threw a small table at a luggage section window. The police tasered him twice and he died. Following the shooting deaths, in separate incidents, of two mounties stationed in northern communities, there were calls for policy changes related to how and when individual officers should call for back-up. One of the world's best-regarded tenor singers, Luciano Pavarotti, died 6th September. His funeral drew thousands including Bono of U2, and fellow tenors Plácido Domingo and José Carreras. Pavarotti succumbed to pancreatic cancer which was diagnosed in July 2006. In January, Apple announced its iPhone, which hit U.S. markets on July and made customers queue in the U.K. in November. Apple's decision to lock the phone to use one network exclusively was criticized as \"anti-competitive\", and hackers started circumnavigating the restrictions imposed on the phone. On January 1, 2007, Slovenia adopted the euro currency, and Romania and Bulgaria joined the European Union. In December, E.U. leaders signed the Treaty of Lisbon, a landmark document which is to redefine foreign policy for the E.U. and creates an E.U. president.

      " Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA, releases study of local emissions. According to the Cambridge Chronicle, a report issued by the city of Cambridge on the topic of greenhouse gas emissions claimed that despite a two-year old pledge to reduce harmful emissions, the amount of carbon dioxide released into the atmosphere in the city has increased. Since 1990, carbon dioxide emissions have increased by 27% in the city, mostly due to industrial processes, says the paper. In 1999, the city joined Cities for Climate Protection, a coalition of towns in Massachusetts interested in reducing their greenhouse gas emissions. In 2002, the city released a study, the Cambridge Climate Protection Plan, which set emission reduction goals for the city. The plan proposed that \"we reduce GHG emissions by 20 percent below 1990 levels. This means the community needs to reduce and prevent annual GHG emissions of 494,400 tons of carbon dioxide.\" While the city has failed thus far to reduce its emissions, it has been experimenting with alternative transportation technology in its vehicles. According to the city's website, Cambridge currently owns and operates 20 electric vehicles and 1 compressed natural gas truck. Additionally, most of Cambridge's fleet of diesel vehicles are currently running on 20% biodiesel, which is \"derived from domestically produced vegetable oil,\" according to the Cambridge Department of Public Works website. \n",

      " Australians more concerned by global warming than terrorism, says Lowy report. The Lowy Institute, established in 2003 with a $30 million endowment from Australian philanthropist Frank Lowy, claims it is \"an independent, non-partisan think tank.\" The report, entitled \"Australians speak 2005: public opinion and foreign policy\", showed that global warming and nuclear proliferation were greater foreign policy concerns than terrorism and illegal immigration. 70 per cent of Australians were worried about global warming, the report stated, while only 63 per cent were worried about international terrorism. The report also noted most Australians believed improving the global environment should be Australia's number one foreign policy goal. Mark Wakeham of Greenpeace said, \"Clearly Australians understand the warnings from scientists about greenhouse pollution far better than our governments do. Once again, the community is leading and governments will be pulled into line.\" He continued by saying, \"Scientists tell us that, to avoid dangerous warming of more than two degrees, we have to cut our greenhouse pollution by at least 60 per cent by 2050. This means moving rapidly and decisively away from dirty coal to clean, renewable sources of energy like solar, wind and energy efficiency.\" The Lowy Institute surveyed 1000 randomly selected people to interview for the report. \n",

      " Electric vehicles can be less green than classic fuel cars, Norwegian study finds. A Norwegian University of Science and Technology study released Thursday found electric vehicles have a potential for higher eco-toxicity and greenhouse impact than conventional cars. The study includes an examination of the electric car's life cycle as a whole rather than a study of the electric car's environmental impact during the use phase. The researchers conducted a comparison of the environmental impact of electric cars in view of different ratios of green-to-fuel electricity energy sources.   In the case of mostly coal- or oil-based electricity supply, electric cars are disadvantageous compared to classic diesel cars with the greenhouse effect impact being up to two times larger. The researchers found that in Europe, electric cars pose a \"10% to 24% decrease in global warming potential (GWP) relative to conventional diesel or gasoline vehicles\". The researchers suggest to improve eco-friendliness of electric vehicles by \"reducing vehicle production supply chain impacts and promoting clean electricity sources in decision making regarding electricity infrastructure\" and using the electric cars for a longer time, so that the use phase plays a more important role in the electric vehicle life cycle. \n",

The European Environment Agency (EEA) released a report which shows that the European Union is on track to meet their Kyoto Protocol commitments to limit and reduce emissions responsible for the greenhouse effect on our earth. The five member states France, Germany, Greece, Sweden and the United Kingdom have already reached the target. All other member states, except Austria, which has to strengthen its efforts, expect to reach the target, too. EEA Executive Director Professor Jacqueline McGlade said: \"It is encouraging that Europe's climate-changing emissions are expected to continue decreasing, outperforming the objectives set by the Kyoto Protocol. Such an accomplishment should encourage all countries to agree on much larger reductions of global emissions, sealing a global deal in Copenhagen this December. Commitments to deep emission cuts are urgently needed to preserve our chances to keep planetary temperature increases below 2ºC.\" \n",

On Friday, the United States House of Representatives passed House Resolution 2998, better known as the American Clean Energy and Security Act of 2009, following days of debate. The final vote was 219–212, with only 8 Republicans voting for the legislation, and 44 Democrats voting against it. The resolution addresses the \"greenhouse effect,\" and calls for a 17% reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020, and an 83% reduction by 2050. In addition, the legislation will establish new requirements for utilities, and various incentives for \"going green.\" The resolution was sponsored by Representative Henry Waxman of California, and Representative Edward Markey of Massachusetts. At 3:09 a.m. (EDT) on Friday morning, a 341 page amendment was added to the resolution. In an attempted filibuster, House Minority Leader John Boehner read the majority of the added amendment, and stated that \"...when you file a 300-page amendment at 3:09 a.m., the American people have a right to know what's in this bill.\" Reactions to the legislation have been mixed, with opponents and advocates speaking out. The President of the Union of Concerned Scientists, Kevin Knobloch, said that the Union was \"thrilled that Congress has finally caught up with science and the American people in recognizing the need to switch on clean energy.\" A report by the The Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank, stated that the legislation would \"damage the economy and hobble growth.\" Most House Republicans opposed the bill for going too far in its regulation, with GOP chairman Mike Pence saying that \"raising the cost of energy is a bad idea in prosperous times.\" Democrat Dennis Kucinich, on the other hand, opposed the bill for not going far enough, calling it an \"illusion\" that \"locks us into a framework that will fail.\" Kucinich pointed out that the bill gives subsidies to coal, which is not a clean source of fuel, and includes greenhouse gas emitters such as trash incinerators under its definition of \"renewable energy.\" \n",

      " EU adopts renewable energy measures. This way, the E.U. wants to contribute in reaching the strategic goal of limiting the global average temperature increase to less than 2°C above pre-industrial levels. The individual targets for countries will need to be established based on national starting points and potentials, according to the plan. The plans don't mention an enforcement mechanism yet. In the summit's conclusions, the E.U. underlines its ambitions as a leading force in international climate protection. German Chancellor Angela Merkel called the targets \"ambitious and credible\". Europe is prepared to even increase the objectives if other developed countries follow suit, and it invites other countries to come forward with their plans for the environment beyond 2012, when the Kyoto protocol ends. In June, Merkel plans to discuss the measures with the other members on the Group of Eight summit. The proposal takes into account the sovereignty of individual countries to determine exactly which energy sources they use. More specifically, each member state should decide if they wish to use nuclear power or not. Some countries oppose the use of nuclear energy as an alternative to fossil fuels, and Germany is even in the process of dismantling its nuclear energy production. France on the other hand produces 70% of its electricity in nuclear power plants. [13% of France's total energy consumption is nuclear.] The report also stresses the importance of nuclear safety in the discussion over nuclear energy. The summit also asked the European Commission to come up with proposals to reduce energy consumption in lighting and offices by 2008 and 2009. The idea is to replace conventional light bulbs with more energy-efficient alternatives such as the energy saving light bulb. Another energy-related topic in the conclusions is an agreement on increased security of energy supply. Through member state solidarity and a more interconnected and integrated market, eastern European countries hope to secure their energy supplies in case Russia would cut the supply. During their two-days summit, the E.U. also discussed economic growth, employment, better regulations and international relations issues. \n",

      " Kyoto Protocol comes into effect. New York — The treaty was proposed in December 1997 and requires signatories to reduce their combined greenhouse gas emissions to 5% below 1990 levels by the year 2012 in an effort to reduce the impact of global warming. Each country has individual targets. Of the major industrialized nations, the USA and Australia are notable absentees from the list of signatories. Both argue that the treaty is flawed and that signing the protocol is not in their national economic interests. The United States produces more CO2 emissions than any other single country in the world, both in total (5,410 million metric tons) and also per capita (20.1 tons per capita). Despite this, the way was paved for ratification of the treaty after Russia signed up in November 2004. Other criticisms of the protocol are that the treaty does not include India and China, or other developing nations. Countries that ratify the treaty will have access to the emerging international market in carbon credits, estimated to be worth billions of dollars each year. This system allows individual countries to trade in their emission allowances - a country can buy credit from another that has cut emissions, and then increase their own carbon dioxide production. \n",

      " Australian report shows emissions increase \"more than doubled since the 1990s\". Atmospheric scientists warn that greenhouse gas emissions are increasing more rapidly, despite global efforts to curb the use of fossil fuels, new research by Australia's Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) shows. According to CSIRO research scientist Dr Mike Raupach, 7.9 billion tonnes of carbon were emitted into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide in 2005 -  a doubling in the rate of increase since 1990 - and the rate of increase continues to accelerate. Data from the Cape Grim air pollution monitoring station in north-west Tasmania shows carbon dioxide emissions have increased by 2.5% each year for the past five years. \"From 2000 to 2005, the growth rate of carbon dioxide emissions was more than 2.5% per year, whereas in the 1990s it was less than 1% per year,\" Dr Raupach says. Dr Raupach, who co-chairs the international Global Carbon Project also, was surprised by his research results. \"It shows recent efforts globally to reduce emissions have had little impact on emissions growth,\" he said. The CSIRO found that in global terms, China has the highest current growth rate in CO2 emissions although it's emissions per person are below the global average. China's accumulated contribution since the start the 1800s is only five per cent of the global total. The USA and Europe have each contributed more than 25% of accumulated global emissions. Carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere — a separate measure to carbon emissions — had also increased at an unprecedented rate. Dr Paul Fraser, also from CSIRO Marine and Atmospheric Research, said that atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide grew by two parts per million in 2005, the fourth year in a row of above-average growth. \"To have four years in a row of above-average carbon dioxide growth is unprecedented,\" Dr Fraser said. He said the trend over recent years suggests the growth rate is accelerating, \"signifying that fossil fuels are having an impact on greenhouse gas concentrations in a way we haven’t seen in the past.\" \n",

      " Conservatives plan to reject budget over newly introduced Kyoto amendment in Canada. The Canadian Conservative Party plans to reject the federal budget. A recently amended provision allowing the government to control greenhouse gas emissions is \"completely unacceptable,\" says its leader Stephen Harper. Harper said Thursday his party plans to vote against the omnibus budget bill if it includes the amendment to the Canadian Environmental Protection Act. It would add greenhouse gas emissions to the list of controlled substances, allowing the Canadian government to regulate those emissions, he contends. \"This is an attempt by the government to get unlimited power to impose multimillion-dollar fines on any basis, without any parliamentary approval or discussion, whatsoever.\" Harper said. The controversial amendment was introduced after a lengthy cabinet debate between Finance Minister Ralph Goodale and others. When the budget was tabled last month, Harper initially said his party would support the bill. He now says the party will oppose it unless the Liberal government removes the amendment. Environment Minister Stéphane Dion, who is attempting to have a $10 million Kyoto implementation plan in place by April 4, said he would be \"very, very pleased\" to fight an election over climate change. The NDP and Bloc Québécois have both said they will oppose the bill. The Liberal Party of Canada has 133 seats, so its defeat seems certain if all four parties hold their positions. Both the NDP and the Bloc also accuse the Liberal party of trying to tack the Kyoto amendment onto the bill without sufficient debate. Bloc leader Gilles Duceppe said that he was not satisfied with a number of provisions in the bill. “First of all it's not enough on Kyoto. We don't know the plan, we didn't discuss the plan,\" Duceppe said. “I'm ready to have an election any time if this is what they want.\" NDP leader, Jack Layton, said \"The Liberals are playing games with the environment. Paul Martin doesn't care about the Kyoto plan. He cares about playing politics and that is what's going on here.\" It will be up to Prime Minister Paul Martin whether a defeat triggers an election. \n",

      " Australian PM pushes for \"full-blooded\" nuclear energy debate. Australian Prime Minister John Howard has told media in Canada that he wants \"a full-blooded debate\" in Australia about the issue of nuclear power. \"I have a very open mind on the development of nuclear energy in my own country,\" he said. \"That includes an open mind on whether or not Australia should in fact process uranium for the purposes of providing fuel for nuclear power in the future in Australia.\" Australia and Canada are two of the world's largest uranium producers, and the nuclear energy issue was discussed at length during Prime Minister Howard's visit to the country this week. Mr Howard said soaring oil prices and environmental concerns from fossil-fuel energy are adding pressure towards the debate in Australia. \"I think it is inevitable. The time at which it will come should be governed by economic considerations,\" Mr Howard said from Ottawa. Australian Greens leader Senator Bob Brown labelled the Prime Minister's call \"a sham\". Senator Brown says the Prime Minister has already made up his mind. \"His talk about a public debate is a complete sham, he's made up his mind,\" he said. \"He's had no mandate, but he's got control of the Senate and therefore we are going headlong into becoming a major agent in the nuclear proliferation right around the world.\" Scientists have said Australia could not develop a nuclear power industry in time to stave off the effects of climate change. Greenpeace Australia says that even if there was a doubling of nuclear energy by 2050 it would only reduce greenhouse gas emissions by five percent, well below the large cuts scientists say are necessary. Academics at NSW University and the University of Technology Sydney have said, \"No private investor would take on the risk without huge government subsidies.\" The NSW Greens MLC Ian Cohen said that after 50 years, the nuclear industry still had not found a way to store its waste safely. \"We don't want it back and we don't want to create it here.\" Steve Shallhorn, chief executive of Greenpeace Australia Pacific says the Prime Minister should have used his trip to Canada to learn why \"nuclear power is not a viable option.\" Mr Shallhorn said that, in Canada, nuclear power has driven up the price of electricity and created dangerous amounts of waste. He says its effect in reducing greenhouse gas emissions is also negligible. \"Nuclear power can only solve a very tiny portion of greenhouse gas problems because electricity is only one source of the problem,\" said Mr Shallhorn. \"Nuclear power is not going to solve emissions from aircraft, from the industrial sector or from industrial processes.\" \"I think it is inevitable. The time at which it will come should be governed by economic considerations,\" Mr Howard said from Ottawa. Australia is one of the world's top coal producers. The Howard government has supported the coal industry in the face of calls for more renewable energy. Treasurer Peter Costello, next-in-line for the prime minister's job, has said \"nuclear power would cost twice as much as coal power, adding that nuclear energy was not economically right for Australia at the present time because it had such large resources of gas and coal.\" John Howard said nuclear power in Australia \"could be closer than some people would have thought a short while ago.\" Federal Industry Minister, Ian Macfarlane, claimed it could be as early as 2020. The Opposition's environment spokesman, Anthony Albanese, said Labor opposed nuclear power on cost, safety, and waste and proliferation grounds. \"Labor will not change that view.\" He said he looks forward to \"Labor ending John Howard's nuclear fantasy.\" Energy experts say that Australia could not develop a nuclear power industry in time to stave off the effects of climate change, and such a program would be prohibitively expensive. A 2005 survey found 47 percent of Australians supported nuclear power and 40 percent opposed it. The federal opposition party, and all six state governments, oppose nuclear power. Australia has a strict \"no new mines\" uranium policy. \n",

      " Recent 'Earth-like planet' found in April 'too hot' for life say some scientists. German and American scientists have announced that the recent planet, Gliese 581c is too hot to host any life that would be found on Earth. It orbits around the star Gliese 581. \"It’s just too hot. I would not recommend mankind to move to that planet right now,\" said Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research astronomer who was part of the study, Dr. Manfred Cuntz who also said that the same system that Gliese 581c is in may have another planet that could be comfortable for humans. The planet, Gliese 581d orbits the same star as Gliese 581c but at a distance of 23 million miles. The researchers say that the planet could have a \"greenhouse\" effect and that water that may be present on the planet would be liquid. If no greenhouse effect is present, the planet would have frozen water. \"We cannot cool down an atmosphere of a planet, but we can heat it up. Despite the adverse conditions of this planet, at least some primitive forms of life may be able to exist on its surface,\" added Cuntz. Some scientists disagree and say that Gliese 581 is very old and that its light is dimmer than that of a newer star. Scientists began to monitor Gliese 581c right after the announcement of its discovery in April for six weeks using the Microvariability and Oscillations of STars (MOST), operated by the Canadian Space Agency. \"Gliese 581 seems remarkably stable over the six weeks it was monitored by MOST. The brightness of the star changed by only a few tenths of a percent over that time. This level of stability means that it provides a stable source of light -- hence heat -- to the surface of planet Gliese 581c. The climate there should not be a wild rollercoaster ride that would make it difficult for life to get a foothold,\" said astronomer at the University of British Columbia, Jaymie Matthews. Matthews says that Gliese 581 is much older than the Sun and Earth and that life should have already evolved on the surface. \"So if Gliese 581 has been around for at least that long, it’s more encouraging for the prospects of complex life on any planet around it,\" added Matthews. \n",

      " Downer welcomes Australian nuclear energy debate. Australia's foreign affairs minister Alexander Downer has given his support for a serious debate on nuclear energy in Australia. Mr Downer's comments follow similar comments made by Australian Prime Minister John Howard in Canada last week. Mr Downer said that climate change has strongly influenced many to change their position on nuclear power and to encourage debate. He encouraged people to keep an open mind on nuclear power within the context of reducing greenhouse gases. The production of nuclear energy produces far fewer greenhouse gas emissions than coal and oil power stations. Mr Downer also said that it would make sense for Australia to investigate nuclear power generation given that it has 30 to 40 percent of the world's Uranium reserves. Mr Downer said any discussion would need to look at whether Australia would build nuclear power stations in the future and whether a Uranium enrichment program would be undertaken. \"There's the question of whether Australia itself would eventually, some time, no doubt in the far distant future, build nuclear power stations,\" he said. \"There's a question of whether Australia would ever enrich uranium - in other words, we go up the processing chain, rather than just dig it out.\" Mr Downer said. Unlike Australian industry minister, Ian MacFarlane and finance minister, Nick Minchin, Mr Downer refused to say when he thought nuclear energy would become a reality in Australia. Mr Downer said the construction of nuclear power plants would depend on two things - political debate and economic considerations. Mr Downer said that nuclear power plants can be very expensive to build and they would need to be comparable in overall cost to oil and coal based power plants for it to make economic sense. Opposition treasury spokesman Wayne Swan has said he does not support Australia building nuclear power plants. He also said that Australia had large energy reserves and has no need for nuclear power generation. \"We are a country with an abundance of energy, we're are optimistic about what can occur with clean coal technologies, we have an abundant supply of gas – I don't see the need for Australia to go down that road.\" \n",

      " US says polar bears are threatened species. The United States Department of the Interior today listed the polar bear as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA), due to the melting of Arctic sea ice that is the bears' habitat. The announcement of the listing was made by Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne. In making the announcement, Kempthorne said he wishes to prevent further losses of polar bears, but he warned against using the Endangered Species Act to \"regulate greenhouse gas emissions from automobiles, power plants, and other sources\", which he called \"a wholly inappropriate use of the ESA law.\" Kempthorne says the Interior Department will apply separate rules from the Marine Mammal Protection Act to the polar bear, which will permit flexibility in economic development as long as the survival of the species is not adversely affected. Kempthorne said the policies \"will ensure the protection of the bear while allowing us to continue to develop our natural resources in the Arctic region in an environmentally sound way.\" The Government of Nunavut fears the decision could lead to a ban on the importation of polar bear hides into the United States. As a result the Nunavut economy could suffer. The polar bear hunt generates $1.5 million (US) per year in revenue. Carl Pope, director of the environmentalist Sierra Club, criticized the Interior Department's decision, saying it was \"riddled with loopholes, caveats and backhanded language that could actually undermine protections for the polar bear and other species\". The government was forced to make a decision regarding the polar bear by May 15, after environmental groups sued the George W. Bush administration for failing to meet a January 9 deadline. The administration was accused of postponing the decision as a way to allow for more Alaskan oil and gas drilling. The purpose of the Endangered Species Act is to protect species that may be in danger of extinction as a result of human action. It aims to achieve this by regulating federal activity in the habitat of threatened species. Commercial activity is not directly regulated, but companies must receive a permit for development in designated habitats. The polar bear is the first animal to be protected under the Endangered Species Act due to the threat that global warming poses to the bears' Arctic habitat. Some environmental groups say they could use the designation to protest the construction of coal power plants located thousands of miles away from the Arctic, which they blame for contributing to greenhouse gases and global warming. However, Barton H. Thompson Jr., a law professor at Stanford University, says that such lawsuits would be difficult to win. \"Interior has a reasonable case here that the connection [between greenhouse gas emmissions and polar bears] is just too far removed,\" he says. If sea ice continues to melt, two-thirds of the polar bear population could be gone by 2050, according to studies released by the United States Geological Survey last September. Also, Louis Fortier of the Canadian research group ArcticNet believes the Arctic Ocean could be ice-free in the summers by 2010. But M. Reed Hopper of the Pacific Legal Foundation, a property-rights group, disputes the notion that the polar bear is severely threatened. He says the government used \"speculative computer modeling\" to make its decision, and he plans to sue the Interior Department. \"Never before has a thriving species been listed under the Environmental Species Act, nor should it be,\" he said. \n",

      " Howard government confirms \"secret nuclear power committee\". An internal government committee has been created to look at Australia's nuclear energy role. The Federal Government has admitted it has set up a \"secret committee\" to examine the economics and science of nuclear power. During a Senate estimates committee, the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet's deputy secretary, Duncan Lewis confirmed that the committee had been formed following statements by US President George W Bush to create a global nuclear energy partnership. He told the Senate estimates that the committee would effectively try to develop an Australian perspective on the American proposal. Labor Opposition environment spokesman, Anthony Albanese, says the information has not been made public because of the sensitivity of the issue. \"This hasn't been announced, the work's been done behind-the-scenes because the Government knows that this is indeed a very dangerous path for Australia to go on,\" he said. Greens Senator Christine Milne said that the establishment of a secret committee to look at nuclear power was deeply troubling: \"Prime Minister John Howard says he wants a full public debate on whether Australia should adopt nuclear power, yet his government has set up a secret committee to examine the matter,\" Senator Milne said. \"The latest evidence about climate change supports the Greens' position that nuclear power is no solution to climate change, as the government claims. As well as being dangerous it is too slow to mobilise,\" Senator Milne said in a media release. Democrats Leader Lyn Allison says it is extraordinary that the Government did not make the details of the committee public. \"It's very clear... that we're looking here at a very secret, narrow and possibly a biased inquiry,\" she said. \"If that's where it is going, in fact we'll be moving as soon as we can to establish a Senate inquiry into this, we think it needs to be open, it needs to be public.\" Senator Allison said in a media release that Howard's push for nuclear power \"is greed and glow in the dark politics...\" \"The Government has no plan for power generation into the future that doesn't add to greenhouse emissions or produce intractable waste. The enrichment process is energy-intensive and Australia is already the world's highest per capita greenhouse gas emitter. We cannot afford another energy guzzling industry, especially when this government has abandoned renewable energy,\" she said. \"Enriching uranium concentrates the isotopes making the uranium more hazardous, more polluting, and makes Australia a greater target for nuclear terrorism.\" Senator Milne said on the Democrats website: \"Australians want leadership on this issue, not knee jerk reactions to what George Bush thinks is a good idea. They want a debate that isn't set up to merely justify selling enriched uranium and nuclear power.\" Anthony Albanese says John Howard's push for a nuclear energy debate would become \"Australia's nightmare.\" Mr Albanese said Mr Howard's views were retrospective and not in Australia's best interests: \"This is classic John Howard whether it be the GST, whether it be the extreme industrial relations agenda, or whether it be this nuclear fantasy which will become Australia's nightmare – John Howard always returns to the past,\" Mr Albanese said in a News Limited article. \"For John Howard to say that there hasn't been a debate on nuclear energy would suggest that he went to sleep in the 50s and he's just woken up.\" Mr Albanese said the dangers and costs of nuclear energy outweighed the energy benefits. \"The problems of cost, safety, waste disposals and nuclear proliferation in the climate of terrorism are more acute today than they've ever been.\" Meanwhile a new study by the Australia Institute has identified several areas on Australia's east coast, where nuclear power plants could be built if the Howard Government decide to take the nuclear energy path. The Australia Institute say they have consulted experts who say that the plant will need to be located on the coast, near transmission lines and be near a major centre with good rail and port access. The institute's Dr Clive Hamilton said the area south of Wollongong, the central coast of New South Wales, the Sunshine Coast and other areas in Queensland and Victoria would be ideal. \"You can't have a nuclear industry without specifying where the nuclear power plants are likely to be,\" he said. \"We're really taking up the Prime Minister's challenge to have a debate about nuclear power in Australia. We want to make it an honest debate and to start talking about where you would put the nuclear power plants if they were to be built.\" Dr Hamilton suggests the nuclear debate barely touched the surface. \"Wherever a nuclear power plant is built in Australia, some people aren't going to like it, that's just an inevitability,\" he said. \"I think if we're going to have a serious nuclear debate rather than just a false debate then we need to start to talk about the reality of building nuclear power plants which, in the end, comes down to location.\" \n",

      " U.S. negotiator calls Kyoto Treaty \"not based on science\". Buenos Aires — The 10th session of the Conference of Parties (COP 10) is being held in the Argentine capital of Buenos Aires; signatories of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change have gathered to discuss issues involving global warming. Senior U.S. negotiator Dr. Harlan Watson came under fire for the United States' refusal to ratify the almost 10 year old Kyoto Treaty (AKA: Kyoto Protocol) which aims to reduce the emission of 6 greenhouse gases in the 55+ signatory nations and requires participating industrialized countries to give money and technology to developing countries. Watson countered these complaints by arguing that, \"Kyoto is a political agreement, it's not based on science.\" He also stated that the United States remains steadfast to its current position on global climate change.  Supporters of the Kyoto Treaty state the protocol's required actions are not sufficient to effect their claimed warming effects. \n",

      " Gaza looters destroy Palestine Authority property. Frenzied destruction of empty Jewish settlements in Gaza by Palestinian looters have marred plans for exploiting those facilities to create much needed jobs for the area. Greenhouses in Gaza have been partly destroyed as crucial equipment was stripped by the Palestinians. Looters took everything from water pumps, plastic sheets, tubing and equipment. This makes at least one third of the hothouses at least temporarily unusable to feed the families of Gaza and for potential export to Israel. The facilities were purchased by a group of Jewish-American donors and given to the Palestinian government to encourage economic development. It was initially anticipated over four thousand Palestinians could be given work at the greenhouses, however all offers have been suspended prior to the damage being assessed and repairs arranged. \n",

      " Arctic ice cap shrank sharply this summer. The Arctic Ice Cap, which floats on the Arctic Ocean, shrank this summer to what experts believe to be its smallest size in a century.   Experts in climate modeling feel this is most likely a consequence of greenhouse gas emissions and will profoundly transform the Arctic later this century. Dr. Ted Scambos and Dr. Mark Serreze, of the National Snow and Ice Data Center in Boulder, Colorado said the change is becoming self-sustaining due to positive feedback effects. Dr. Serreze, said \"With all that dark open water, you start to see an increase in Arctic Ocean heat storage. Come autumn and winter that makes it a lot harder to grow ice, and the next spring you're left with less and thinner ice. And it's easier to lose even more the next year.\" Dr. Scambos said \"The consecutive record-low extents make it pretty certain a long-term decline is underway.\" The Little Ice Age ended a century ago. \n",

      " University of Calgary scientist Keith cracks carbon capture conundrum. A University of Calgary research team developed a new method for extracting carbon dioxide (CO2) directly from the air — a fundamental shift in carbon capture technology enabling capture of the most common greenhouse gas from so-called diffuse sources like aircraft, trucks and automobiles that represent half of the greenhouse gases emitted globally. Professor David Keith, Director of University of Calgary's (UofC) Institute for Sustainable Energy, Environment and Economy (ISEEE) and a team of researchers from UofC's Energy and Environmental Systems Group built and operated a prototype system this summer producing results that compared favourably with commercial carbon capture systems. Two 'provisional' patents have been filed on the technology but Keith warns there are still \"many pitfalls along the path to commercialization.\" Using a process adapted from the pulp-and-paper industry that halves the cost of CO2 air capture in their custom-built tower, Professor Keith and his team captured the equivalent of about 20 tonnes per year of CO2 (approximately equal to the yearly output of one person in North America) directly from the air with less than 100 kilowatt-hours of electricity per tonne of carbon dioxide on a single square metre of scrubbing material. \"This means that if you used electricity from a coal-fired power plant, for every unit of electricity you used to operate the capture machine, you'd be capturing 10 times as much CO2 as the power plant emitted making that much electricity,\" explains Professor Keith. A report co-authored by Keith in the American Chemical Society's journal Environmental Science & Technology  explains \"nearly all current research on carbon capture and storage (CCS) focuses on capturing CO2 from large, stationary sources such as power plants. Such plans usually entail separating CO2 from flue gas, compressing it, and transporting it via pipeline to be [stored] underground.\" Using CO2 air capture technology, \"a company could, in principle, contract with an oil sands plant near Fort McMurray to remove CO2 from the air and could build its air capture plant wherever it's cheapest — China, for example — and the same amount of CO2 would be removed,\" says Professor Keith in a UofC press release. \"While it's important to get started doing things we know how to do, like wind power, nuclear power, and 'regular' carbon capture and storage,\" Professor Keith continues, \"it's also vital to start thinking about radical new ideas and approaches to solving this problem.\" ISEEE's Executive Director David Layzell points out that \"energy-efficient and cost-effective air capture could play a valuable role in complementing other approaches for reducing emissions from the transportation sector, such as biofuels or electric vehicles.\" \n",

      " Bali climate change conference begins. Representatives of more than 180 nations gathered on the Indonesian island of Bali today to kick off a United Nations-sponsored conference on global climate change. The U.N. hopes the meeting will conclude with a road map toward a new agreement on reducing the types of air pollution many scientists believe are driving changes in the earth's climate. The Bali meeting aims to get countries to commit to working out a new agreement on emissions cuts to extend or replace the Kyoto Protocol, which expires in 2012. Conference president Rachmat Witoelar of Indonesia told reporters that a detailed proposal is not necessary at this stage, but participation by all nations is vital. \"We will be happy if this Bali road map is general so we will not push for a very detailed in this short time,\" he said. \"The introduction, the process is important.\" As the conference opened, Australia's new prime minister, Kevin Rudd, signed the Kyoto Protocol, limiting his country's greenhouse gas emissions. That act earned a standing ovation in Bali, and focused attention on the failure of the United States to sign the protocol - the only developed nation not to have done so. \"While the current U.S. delegation will not join in serious negotiations over mandatory limits on global warming pollution, they won't be around when the final deal is made in 2009. A new team will be on the field with a very different game plan,\" he said. \"The other nations must not allow the U.S. to derail, delay or water down the Bali mandate.\" Senior U.S. negotiator Harlan Watson denied his country was blocking progress, saying the U.S. had merely chosen a different course. \"It's up to each country to do the analysis and analyze for themselves if the target is do-able. Obviously the U.S. came to a different conclusion,\" he said. \"We respect the decisions other countries have made and of course ask them to respect the decision that we've made.\" President Bush says that the Kyoto Protocol threatened U.S. economic growth, and believes that any future climate-change agreement will be ineffective unless it includes rapidly developing nations such as China and India, which are among the world's largest producers of greenhouse gases. Other subjects on the agenda in Bali include saving the world's remaining forests, and sharing technologies to help developing nations grow in less-polluting ways. The U.N. also hopes to finalize a fund to help countries affected by global warming to cope with the impacts. The money could go toward flood-proof houses, better water management, and crop diversification. The Bali conference will continue until December 14. Thousands of government representatives, scientists and activists are attending.

      " Australian–US team of scientists finds Atlantic warming causes Pacific climate trends. A team of scientists from Australia and US has found a solution for a challenging problem in climate research. Climate models predicted more greenhouse gases would weaken the equatorial Pacific trade winds. While previous research supposed natural variability alone accounted for cooling in the eastern Pacific, this study highlights a previously overlooked climate feedback: as the Atlantic warms, it alters the winds over the Pacific, depressing the ocean temperature there. Coauthor Malte Stuecker of the University of Hawaii Meteorology Department reports that \"Our study documents that some of the largest tropical and subtropical climate trends of the past 20 years are all linked: Strengthening of the Pacific trade winds, acceleration of sea level rise [three times faster than the global average] in the western Pacific, eastern Pacific surface cooling, the global warming hiatus, and even the massive droughts in California\". His colleague cauthor Fei-Fei Jin adds, \"We are just starting to grasp the scope of the impacts of this global atmospheric reorganization and of the out-of phase temperature trends in the Atlantic and Pacific regions\". Coauthor Axel Timmermann of the University of Hawaii notes a further amplifying effect: \"Stronger trade winds in the equatorial Pacific also increase the upwelling of cold waters to the surface. The resulting near-surface cooling in the eastern Pacific amplifies the Atlantic–Pacific pressure seesaw, thus further intensifying the trade winds [...] It turns out that the current generation of climate models underestimates the extent of the Atlantic–Pacific coupling, which means that they cannot properly capture the observed eastern Pacific cooling, which has contributed significantly to the leveling off, or the hiatus, in global warming.\" \n",

      " Thousands demand climate change action. Thousands of people across Australia are taking part in protests calling on the Federal Government to ratify the Kyoto Protocol. The 'Walk Against Warming' is part of an international day of action in 40 countries, coinciding with the United Nations climate change talks in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. According to the Walk Against Warming group, \"the need to reduce greenhouse gases is at crisis point, we must act now for the sustainability of our planet for future generations.\" Melinda Cook, Nature Conservation Council of New South Wales official, says governments need to take much stronger action on the issue of Climate Change. \"This international day has been called to put pressure on Australia and the US to ratify and to make sure governments are aware that the community is demanding serious commitments and action on greenhouse gas reduction,\" said Cook. Siding with the United States, the Australian Federal Government has refused to ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, arguing it is damaging to their economic interests. Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell says Australia is focused on measures that should be taken after Kyoto expires in 2012. \"We need to do something that suits the developed world, something that suits the rapidly developing world, partnerships, technologies, economic mechanisms that drive us towards that,\" said Campbell. \"We're nowhere near that at the moment and Australia wants to be a constructive part of driving us towards a very useful post-Kyoto regime.\" Protesters across Australia are using the International Day of Action on Climate Change to demand the government adopt a clean energy policy. Hundreds of people marched through Sydney on Saturday to mark the day. The protest against global warming coincides with the 12-day conference in Montreal, which will discuss climate change measures and future international action when the Kyoto Protocol expires at the end of 2012. Australia and the United States are the only western industrialised nations which refuse to ratify the global Kyoto Protocol. Australia has delegates at the Montreal meeting, but will only act as observers. Melinda Cook said scientists had predicted huge negative consequences including extreme weather and even social and economic impacts if steps were not taken now. Cook also said governments must make a \"serious commitment\" not to build any more coal fire powered stations. The United States Bush administration and the Australian Howard Government have refused to ratify the Kyoto agreement, which pledges industrialised nations to cut carbon dioxide levels to 5.2 per cent below 1990 levels between 2008 and 2012. Global Action Up to a million people will take to the streets of more than 100 cities across dozens of countries today to demand greater action on global warming. Organizers of the protests say the world's leading industrialised nations had failed to make an impact on climate change and some, in particular Britain, were backsliding on their environmental commitments. The United Nations meeting in Montreal, will be attended by representatives of 189 countries. The centerpiece of the International Day of Climate Protest will be a mass protest in Montreal, where at least 15,000 people are expected to lobby delegates. Across the planet, protests are being held in locations from Helsinki to Seoul. In Washington, drivers of fuel-efficient hybrid cars will rally around the White House. In New Orleans - devastated by Hurricane Katrina in August - there will be a \"Stop Global Warming\" street party in the French Quarter. \"There is probably very little we can expect [from Montreal] because we are doing nothing to keep fossil fuel in the ground. All these techno-fixes are a waste of time if we continue to burn fossil fuel at the same rate,\" said George Monbiot, an academic and environment commentator, who will address a rally in London. \"There is a lot of cynicism about what the British government is doing. [Prime Minister] Tony Blair has promised much and persuaded many that he will deliver but it has turned out to be rubbish. Blair had no intention of doing anything on climate change other than talk about it. But this weekend's protests are taking place in a changed context - the media are listening and finally we have to make the politicians listen.\" \n",

      " Scientists warn thawing Siberia may trigger global meltdown. Russian researchers warn that Western Siberia has begun to thaw as a result of global warming. The frozen peat bogs in this region may hold billions of tons of methane gas, which may be released into the atmosphere. Methane is a greenhouse gas 22 times more powerful than carbon dioxide. Sergei Kirpotin, of Tomsk State University warned New Scientist that the event is an \"ecological landslide that is probably irreversible and is undoubtedly connected to climatic warming\". David Viner, of the University of East Anglia told The Guardian: \"When you start messing around with these natural systems, you can end up in situations where it's unstoppable\". He also warns that this event was not considered by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. In May, scientists from the University of Alaska found methane \"hotspots\" in eastern Siberia where the gas bubbles out from thawing permafrost bogs at a rate that prevents the surface from freezing. The permafrost has been intact for 11,000 years and started melting 3 to 4 years ago, according to Kirpotin. \n",

      " Neste Oil to build world's largest biodiesel plant in Singapore. Finnish company Neste Oil have announced that they intend to construct the world's largest biodiesel plant in Singapore at a cost of €440 million. The NExBTL facility will be Neste's third such project, and is intended to have a maximum capacity of 800,000 tonnes a year. Demand for biofuels is expected to rise greatly over the next few years, as they are often cited as a good way to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and are viewed as a renewable alternative to crude oil which has been at record high prices in recent months. The site has been strategically selected to be close to Malaysia and Indonesia, both of whom are leading world suppliers of palm oil, which is intended to be the main fuel for the plant. Between them they account for 80% of global production. However, the use of palm oil is controversial, as some environmental scientists and campaigners believe using it will have a negative effect as increased demand in turn causes higher food prices and greater levels of deforestation. Earlier this year, Greenpeace attempted to stop a palm oil tanker ship destined to Neste's existing biodiesel plant in Porvoo, Finland, but failed to stop the delivery. In addition to the Porvoo plant, which began operations earlier this year and is at its capacity production of 170,000 tonnes, Neste plan a second plant to open in 2009. The new plant will increase demand for palm oil, as it will require 200,000 hectares of palm oil plantations to supply the million tonnes of oil it requires per annum. \"The new plantations are to be set up mainly in Indonesia, and increasingly in swamp rain forests,\" said Greenpeace's Lauri Myllyvirta. When such terrain is cleared of trees, the peaty soil begins to dry out. \"In the years that follow, it releases all of the carbon that had been stored in it\", Myllyvirta continues. He concludes that he believes palm oil cultivated in such conditions produces ten times the carbon dioxide emissions of fossil fuels. Jarmo Honkamaa, director of Neste's biofuel sector, countered these claims with his belief that the gas balance remains positive and points to Neste statistics which say biodiesel diesel produces 40-60% less greenhouse gas emissions than standard diesel. Another potential problem has been highlighted by Citigroup, who voiced concerns that Neste may not be able to complete the project on time and within the intended budget. Recently, Neste added a standard diesel production line at their Porvoo refinery. This was finished this year, approximately one year late and at an actual cost of €750 million, versus a budget of €500 million. Neste CEO Risto Rinne said in response, \"we have learned our lesson,\" regarding the miscalculations on the new facility, and said that this knowledge, coupled with that obtained during construction of the Porvoo biodiesel plant, had been factored into calculations regarding the Singapore plant. Construction on the third facility will start early next year, and is scheduled to end in 2010. Neste said in a statement that the investment was \"part of Neste Oil's strategic goal of becoming the world's leading renewable diesel producer.\" \n",

On Friday, a new generation solar powered cargo vessel, the Auriga Leader has docked in North America for the first time.  Toyota Motor Corp will employ this car carrier for automobile shipments to Europe and North America from Japan.  The vessel will be operated by the Japanese-based NYK Line. Auriga Leader has 328 solar panels to provide 40 kilowatts, about 10% of the ship's power while sitting idling in dock. This amount of energy is the equivalent to the power used by ten average homes. \"This is the first ship to direct the solar power into the ship's main electrical grid. It's helping all of the time, and its helping with everything, like the ship's thrusters and the hydraulics for the steering gear,\" said Brian Mason, national manager of marine logistics and export for Toyota. The panels are installed on the ship’s car-carrier, and then connected to the onboard 440 volt electrical network.  Nippon Yusen K.K. and Nippon Oil Corp created the Auriga Leader's US$ 1.6 million innovative  green technology solar power grid.  The cargo ship has a length of 200 meters (656 ft) and gross tonnage of 60,000 GT, which is capable of carrying 6,400 automobiles. Richard Steinke, executive director of the Port of Long Beach said of the joint demonstration project, \"From our standpoint, it's another positive step,\" to reduce diesel emissions and the release of greenhouse gas. \n",

      " Clearing the air: Positions of Canadian parties vis-à-vis the environment. In the lead-up to the 2008 Canadian federal elections much speculation was made about environmental issues and initiative, with various parties maneuvering to claim some portion of the green mantle. But it was the Liberal party which first brought a full-blown policy to the public. In the months since the Green Shift initiative was brought forth, the political pundits and activists have both talked about this year as the first election where the environment would be a major issue on the minds of voters, and possibly a decisive one for the electorate. It's indeed true the environment ranks very high in minds of voters across the country, particularly among young voters. One national survey of Canadians between 18 and 25 finds the environment is the top issue. A poll of all voters found it to be the third most important single issue over all, behind the economy and health care, but the poll suggested that no one issue has really caught the attention of the electorate with many issues gaining similar attention. The parties themselves seem indecisive, trying to claim a focus on environmental issues but rarely making specific proposals or promises, with the notable exception of the Liberals whose platform has been targeted by opponents and commentators as \"wildly experimental\" and \"doesn't go deep enough\" by turns. Examining the platforms of the New Democratic Party regarding air pollution and global warming as available on their website, one is struck by a lack of substance. Reference is made to C-377, the Climate Change Accountability Act, which the NDP calls \"Layton's Kyoto-Plus Bill\", which was passed in 2006. The party believes Canada can achieve its Kyoto requirements by 2012, though no mention is made of how a Layton government would do so. In June of 2008 the Liberals tabled a plan, the Green Shift, which they claim would reduce Canada's greenhouse gas emissions 20% under 1990 emissions - well below the 6% required by Canadian law when Canada ratified the Kyoto Accord - by 2020, which is rather after the 2008-2012 phase-in period required by that same law. The method of performing this reduction would be to shift the Canadian tax system, reducing income and revenue taxes by replacing them with taxes on greenhouse gas emissions. The plan generated considerable discussion and opposition, and the party has back-pedaled in some portions and added on in others, as well as announcing a couple of separate initiatives to soften the effects for farmers, homeowners, and fishermen among others. A more diverse approach than solely a \"Carbon Tax\" is proposed in the Green Party's platform, which presents an almost holistic approach of adherence to the Kyoto obligations, \"Cap and trade\" of carbon emissions, industry development with both green technology R&D and regulation as well as consumer subsidies, and their own version of a carbon tax. Alone of the parties they specifically mention the role of international diplomacy/trade as a part of their approach. Such an approach appears to be anathema to the Conservatives, whose mantra since their election has been that Kyoto cannot be complied with without forcing an economic recession on the country, and used the Throne Speech of 2007 to reiterate that position. They have opposed cap-and-trade schemes in the past, but their platform for this election states their plan to reduce greenhouse gas emissions includes emissions caps for \"four air pollutants commonly associated with smog and acid rain,\" as well as \"tough emission reduction targets\". In contrast to the laundry-list of unconnected initiatives on the Conservative's website, the clean platform pamphlet created by the Bloc Québécois makes a simple and apparently heartfelt statement on the environment: Just how they plan to enforce the Kyoto obligations is not stated, though they do discuss a carbon market, and tax incentives for home heating upgrade and transportation. There seems to be a wide if somewhat shallow interest in the electorate as to just what each party is offering on the environmental file. But with sketchy platforms regarding environmental issues, it's no wonder some of the parties have turned to the subject of economics in recent days. \n",

      " Rocket carrying NASA carbon dioxide satellite crashes into ocean. The rocket carrying NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory has crashed, sending the remains of the atmosphere observation satellite into the ocean off the coast of Antarctica. Shortly before the crash, the 'payload fairing' failed to deploy from the craft. \"Several minutes into the flight of the Taurus rocket carrying NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory spacecraft, launch managers declared a contingency after the payload fairing failed to separate,\" said NASA in a statement on their website. \"The spacecraft did not reach orbit and likely landed in the Pacific Ocean near Antarctica\". The cause of the failure to deploy and the crash are still under investigation. \"A Mishap Investigation Board will be immediately convened to determine the cause of the launch failure,\" added the statement. Steve Cole, a spokesperson for NASA told Bloomberg L.P., \"the mission is lost. At this point no one is exactly sure what the cause is\". The rocket that would have carried the observatory into space, a Taurus XL, took off from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California in the United States, at approximately 4:55 a.m. EST. Approximately 10 minutes into the mission, the payload failed to separate and a contingency was activated, but was unsuccessful. The Orbiting Carbon Observatory was the latest mission in NASA's ongoing study of the global carbon cycle. It would have been the first spacecraft dedicated to studying atmospheric carbon dioxide, the most significant human-produced greenhouse gas and the principal human-produced driver of climate change. The cost of the project was US$273 million. \n",

      " World climate conference in Nairobi. The 12th UN-Climate Conference was opened in Nairobi on Monday November 6, 2006. The aim of the negotiations is to find ways of assisting the developing countries to adapt to climate change. The formulation of goals for lowering greenhouse gas emissions after the Kyoto-Protocol runs out in 2012 is high on the agenda. The World Meteorological Organisation (WMO) reported half-a-percent rise in CO2 concentration in the atmosphere during 2005. This rise is destined to continue unless more positive action is taken. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) forecasts crop failures, flooding and threats to freshwater supplies. Actions to mitigate the effects of climate change in developing countries include developing new species of food crops, constructing sea defences, planting vegetation, improving the water-supply infrastructre in vulnerable areas and increasing public awareness of the need to conserve water. Some 6,000 delegates will discuss these issues 6 - 17 November 2006. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) senior-level round-table discussion on International Technology Cooperation on Environmentally Sound Technologies will take place on Tuesday, 14 November, 13.15 - 14.45 Of special interest will be the new report from UNFCCC on how climate change will affect the African continent. \n",

      " Climate Negotiations soon to conclude in Bali; UN \"concerned by the pace of things\". After almost two weeks of negotiations, this years United Nations Convention on Climate Change (UNCCC) is soon going to end, Friday being scheduled as the last day of the talks, with an extension until Saturday being possible if agreement can not be reached beforehand. While the head of the UNFCCC Secretariat, Yvo de Boer, stressed from the onset that actual targets for emission reductions were not to be expected to be agreed on, the inclusion of a target frame for industrialized nations is being debated after all. However, his stated goal of deciding on a roadmap for negotiations, which he said needed to address the matter of Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions reductions after 2012, and would have to be concluded by 2009, is not yet achieved, there being disagreement on a matter of points. China for example restated a position it had made at the beginning of the first week, calling for 2010 as target year for the so called \"Bali Roadmap\". But a bigger point of contention is that the EU and the vast majority of the 190 nations participating in the conference want to set a target of a 25-40% cut in GHG emissions. The U.S., along with Canada and Japan, are refusing to agree to any targets at this point. The EU and others say it is important to set targets now, to get a head start in the fight against global warming. The U.S. says targets should come later, after negotiations begin. The latest to be heard by Sean Heron, who is reporting on behalf of the Wikinews on site, regarding the ongoing negotiations was a statement by a Pakistani official, saying that the US had made a new proposal, and that he was feeling more optimistic than he had the day before. The official spoke in the press conference room, excusing the Ambassador Munir Akram, who was supposed to give a briefing on behalf of the Group of 77 and China, but couldn't make it, as negotiations, due also to the new American suggestion, were still ongoing at 11 pm local time. \n",

      " Humans may have contributed to 2003 European heatwave. Commentators have suggested that in the future this may open the way for lawsuits against heavy polluters by persons whose livelihoods have been affected by adverse climate change. However, the report stesses that though it is in fact impossible to pin any specific extreme climate event on either global warming or natural climate variation, human activities increase the frequency of such events. The study is based upon climate activity during the last 50 years, which can only be replicated with computer models which include human forcing (CO2 and other greenhouse gases (GHGs)). However, even within a warmer world the summer of 2003 was anomalously warm in Europe. Most simulations of 2003 climate produce cooler weather in Europe than what actually happened.  It is not yet known if flaws in the models cause this difference, if the warmth of 2003 was part of a trend, or 2003 was merely unusually hot. If there will be a warming trend, a model predicts that such summers could become an event of 1-in-2 probability only by 2050. In the Americas, a series of sudden weather changes has been more frequent in the last 15 years since the discovery of the phenomenon knows as El Niño, in which vast regions of North and South America suffered weather extremes ranging from high tides to extreme hail, rain and snowstorms during summer and winter seasons following extremely hot summers. There's still no scientific evidence that El Niño is directly influenced by human factors. \n",

      " Brown promises Britain will lead world in fight against climate change. UK Chancellor Gordon Brown promises that UK will lead the world in the fight against global warming. The Stern Review, the first about the economic effects of climate change, is published today. Commissioned by the British Government and prepared by Sir Nicholas Stern, former top economist at the World Bank, it forecasts that, if action is not taken now, the world will suffer an economic disaster on an unprecedented scale. 100 million people will be refugees from floods caused by rising water levels, drought caused by the melting of glaciers will affect 1 in 6 of the world's population, up to 40% of present wildlife species will become extinct and the world economy will shrink by 20%. Sir Nicholas claims that these forecasts are based on the best available scientific evidence about the extent and effects of climate change. He does not claim absolute certainty, only a high degree of probability that the world is facing economic catastrophe if action is not taken immediately. An expenditure of just 1% of the world's wealth now could avert it. Spending £1 now could save £5, or even more, in the future. The effects of global warming can be contained, says the Review, if about 1% of the world's GDP is invested in reducing the emissions of greenhouse gases. This investment must take place over the next 10 to 20 years otherwise the effects of climate change could be disastrous on a scale comparable to the great wars and the slump of the first half of the last century. There has to be action at national, regional and international levels. The Review concludes that the actions to be taken include emissions trading, doubling investment in research and development of low carbon energy sources, curbing deforestation and supporting adaptation in poorer countries by developing crops appropriate to the changed climatic conditions. The Stern Review shows that the scientific evidence for global warming is \"overwhelming\", said Prime Minister Blair. Chancellor Gordon Brown said that Britain will take the lead in persuading the world of the seriousness of the problem. All the major political parties in Britain have been discussing climate change. The Review is attracting a great deal of media attention. Salient among the views being reported are those of a number of experts including the following: Professor Bill Mcguire, Benfield UCL Hazard Research Centre who says that Stern has greatly underestimated the effects of global warming. Martin Livermore, The Scientific Alliance asserts that \"climate is not driven primarily by human use of fossil fuels\" and that the money to be spent is unlikely to have much effect: it would be better spent on the world's poor. Pia Hansen, European Commission Spokeswoman says doing nothing is not an option, we must act now. Simon Retallack, UK Think Tank IPPR - this (Review) removes the last refuge of the \"do-nothing\" approach on climate change, particularly in the US. Tom Delay, The Carbon Trust - The Review offers a huge business opportunity. Richard Lambert,CBI Director Genera says that a global system of carbon trading is urgently needed. Charlie Kronick, Greenpeace - now the government must act and, among other things, invest in efficient decentralised power stations and tackle the growth of aviation. Concurrently with the publication of the Stern Review, the United Nations reports that emissions from the industrialsed world are still rising.  There has been a 2.4% increase in emissions across 41 industrialised countries in the first four years of this century. Britain, France and Germany are near to achieving their Kyoto Protocol targets, but the US is the biggest polluter and its emissions have been increasing. The Kyoto Protocol calls for a reduction of 5% of pollutants below 1990 levels. There has been a reduction of 3.3% since then but this has been the result of the collapse of industry in Eastern Europe which has counterbalanced the increases in the rich countries. The Stern Review suggests that the Kyoto targets are too modest. \n",

      " China bans free plastic bags. The People's Republic of China has banned free plastic shopping bags in a move to take effect from June 1, 2008. The decision made by the Chinese Cabinet, the State Council, is intended to reduce the amount of plastic bags used in China, currently being estimated at three billion per day. The State Council also announced that at the same time as the ban, the manufacturing, sale and even use of very thin plastic bags, which are defined as being under 0.025mm thick, will be banned. Any company that does not follow this ban can be fined. The ban of free plastic bags and complete ban on very thin bags will, the government hopes, help reduce the amount of crude oil used for plastic packaging, which is currently at five million tonnes per year according to Times Online. The notice issued by the Chinese government said: “We should encourage people to return to carrying cloth bags, using baskets for their vegetables.” The People's Republic of China is not the first country to ban or restrict plastic shopping bags and the notice names Uganda and South Africa according to CNN. Many supermarkets in the European Union have voluntarily adopted methods to reduce usage of plastic bags, which often also consist of charging for bags (e.g. Germany) or rewarding customer loyalty points for returning used carrier bags. Still, many of the world's leading polluting countries, including the United States of America, have not yet introduced any legislation intended to reduce the usage of plastic bags. The United States Environmental Protection Agency claimed that in 2000 only 1% of plastic bags in the United States were recycled. The People's Republic of China has attracted a lot of attention in the past for having possibly the highest greenhouse emissions in the world, disproportionate to the size of its economy, according to The Telegraph. Times Online quoted a Chinese activist as saying that plastic bags are not the main problem and the government needed to make people care more about the environment. \n",

      " U.S. government report says climate change is human-made. On Friday, thirteen agencies within the United States government jointly issued the Climate Science Special Report, declaring that roughly 90% of climate change is caused by human activity, most notably the production of carbon dioxide by the burning of fossil fuels.   This directly contradicts assertions made by politicians within the administration of the current president, Donald Trump. The report notes, \"It is extremely likely that human influence has been the dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century[...] For the warming over the last century, there is no convincing alternative explanation supported by the extent of the observational evidence.\" Officially, the report was submitted through the Trump Administration's Office of Science and Technology Policy, to which President Trump has not appointed a head. The official response from the rest of the White House, given to the press by White House spokesperson Raj Shah, reads as follows: \"The climate has changed and is always changing. As the Climate Science Special Report states, the magnitude of future climate change depends significantly on 'remaining uncertainty in the sensitivity of Earth's climate to [greenhouse gas] emissions[...] In the United States, energy related carbon dioxide emissions have been declining, are expected to remain flat through 2040, and will also continue to decline as a share of world emissions.\" The report clocks in at roughly 500 pages and places the human contribution to the increase in the Earth's temperature at 92–123% since 1950.  As explained by co-author Katherine Hayhoe, the space over 100% indicates counteraction of forces that have a cooling effect, like sun-blocking dust kicked into the upper atmosphere by volcanoes.   Overall, the report calls the past 115 years \"the warmest in the history of modern civilization.\" The study cites several factors, called \"tipping points,\" that might make global climate change more intense, such as changes in El Niño and other major patterns in ocean currents, the loss of arctic and antarctic ice sheets, and the release of methane, a greenhouse gas, from rotting material as previously permafrozen ground begins to thaw and cites both the wildfires in California and Superstorm Sandy for effects due to global climate change.   It predicts one scenario in which ocean levels rise as much as 8 feet (2.4 m) by the year 2100. Unlike with previous studies on climate change released by U.S. government agencies, said one lead author, David Fahey of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Trump Administration does not appear to have made an effort to block publication of the report or alter the wording describing its scientific findings, though there were some alterations to the description of U.S. policy with respect to the Paris Climate Accords. Fahey remarked, \"I'm quite confident to say there has been no political interference in the scientific messages from this report...] Whatever fears we had weren't realized.\" Head of the Environmental Protection Agency Scott Pruitt and Secretary of Energy Rick Perry have both said publicly that carbon dioxide does not cause much global warming. Phil Duffy of the Woods Hole Research Center noted, \"This is a federal government report whose contents completely undercut [the Trump Administration's] policies, completely undercut the statements made by senior members of the administration.\" President Trump has announced plans to withdraw the United States form the Paris Climate Accords, in which participating countries pledge to reduce carbon emissions, and to loosen federal laws regulating fossil fuels. The Climate Science Special Report is part of the fourth National Climate Assessment, the last of which was in 2014. The National Climate Assessments are required by a law passed by the United States Congress in 1990. \n",

      " American botanist Lou Jost discovers world's smallest orchid. American botanist Lou Jost, one of the world's leading orchid hunters, has discovered the smallest orchid in the world among the roots of a larger plant in a nature reserve in Bolivia, South America. The 2.1mm wide flowers have transparent petals, which are only one cell thick. The finding tops the previous record of Platystele jungermannioides with 2.5mm flowers. Lou Jost discovered the new species accidentally, looking at a bigger plant from the Cerro Candelaria reserve in the eastern Andes. The reserve was created by a British organisation World Land Trust in partnership with Fundacion EcoMinga, for which the discoverer works. In fact, Ecuador is the place of discovery of more than 1,000 new species of orchids in the past century. \"I found it among the roots of another plant that I had collected, another small orchid which I took back to grow in my greenhouse to get it to flower. A few months later I saw that down among the roots was a tiny little plant that I realised was more interesting than the bigger orchid. Looking at the flower is often the best way to be able to identify which species of orchid you've got hold of – and can tell you whether you're looking at an unknown species or not.\" he said. The finding was identified as belonging to genus Platystele, like the previous record holder, and is the 60th new species of orchid that Dr Jost had discovered in the past decade. \n",

      " Venus was once more Earth-like than previously thought. New data from the European Space Agency's Venus Express mission suggest that Venus was once Earth-like but later evolved in a different way.  The findings, published in the journal Nature on Thursday, also confirm that there is lightning on Venus. \"The two planets were, in fact, very similar in the earlier days of the solar system,\" said Venus Express team scientist Hakan Svendem, \"And they have then evolved in different directions, but according to the same rules and explanations.\"   Professor Fred Taylor of the University of Oxford, another scientist on the mission, said \"Our new data make it possible to construct a scenario in which Venus started out like the Earth - possibly including a habitable environment, billions of years ago - and then evolved to the state we see now.\" Unlike the Earth, Venus lacks a magnetic shield to protect it from the solar wind, a stream of charged particles ejected from the sun.  As a result, hydrogen, helium, and oxygen are blown away from the atmosphere on Venus much faster than on Earth.  The scientists believe that Venus may once have had liquid water oceans on its surface which, as a result of the solar wind, were largely removed during the first billion years after the formation of the Solar System.   \"Eventually the oceans boiled off, and all the water ended up as water vapor in the atmosphere,\" Svedhem said. Data from the magnetometer instrument on Venus Express confirm that there is lightning on Venus, a once controversial idea.   In fact, the findings suggest that lightning is more common on Venus than on Earth. Unlike the Earth, Venus has undergone runaway greenhouse warming and now has an average surface temperature of 467 degrees Celsius.  Some believe that studying how this change came about could lead to insights into how to prevent undesired climate change on Earth.   \"Understanding the influencing factors of global warming on Venus could help us in mitigating the threat here on Earth,\" said United Kingdom Minister for Science and Innovation Ian Pearson. \n",

      " Wal-Mart accused of workers rights violations. A class-action suit has been filed with the Superior court of the state of California accusing Wal-Mart of failing to ensure their suppliers' employees work in acceptable conditions. The suit, representing workers from six countries across four continents, conceals the identities of 17 workers from China, Bangladesh, Indonesia, Swaziland and Nicaragua in addition to four Californians cited as also representing others from the state. The complaint accuses Wal-Mart of failing to adequately police garment suppliers and ensure that workers are not kept in sweatshop conditions, and that this is in breach of their own Code of Conduct for foreign suppliers.  Wal-Mart counters that they have an extensive programme to ensure suppliers adhere to their Code of Conduct; that 200 full-time inspectors are employed to check supplier factories, and 108 factories have been permanently banned as suppliers.  However, this is mainly for child labor violations. This is part of an ongoing campaign against Wal-Mart by the International Labor Rights Fund [1]; a labor rights group opposed to many of the business practices of Wal-Mart that they claim encourage unacceptable working conditions and salaries in developing countries. \n",

      " New Zealand Green party rates other parties on climate change policies. The Green party of Aotearoa New Zealand has ranked other political parties in New Zealand based on their policies and action taken on climate change. The results were announced at a Greens picnic today by co-leader, Doctor Russel Norman at his State of the Planet speech. The top party was themselves, Labour (Government) in second with Dr Norman saying they are \"too frightened to do what needs to be done,\", the Māori party in third, then National, United Future, New Zealand First and lastly, ACT, leaving out Jim Anderton's Progressive Coalition party from being ranked. According to the Greens, ACT is denying how important climate change really is. However not even Dr Norman is satisfied being at the top of the list, stating that more can be improved on. \"We have been leading the debate but we don't have all the answers.\" Dr Norman does say that if the Greens were not in Parliament then all the other parties would be \"floundering\" because they would not know what to do. Dr Norman says that New Zealand needs to do our part in helping Earth face its biggest challenge. In Dr Norman's speech he also encouraged the other parties to take more action regarding climate change. \"The results show that while the parties are more than happy to jump aboard the climate change band wagon, when it comes down to it, there is still a lack of political will to take firm action.\" Dr Norman said: \"Most parties had yet to tackle the tough issue of reducing greenhouse gas emissions in the agricultural sector - this sector accounts for about 50 percent of New Zealand’s total emissions. They fared only slightly better in increasing forested area and reducing emissions from the electricity sector.\" Dr Norman said that we are heading towards a \"global catastrophe.\" \n",

      " New Zealand meteorologist Auer dies. New Zealand Meteorologist Augie Auer has died, suffering a heart attack while dining with family members in Melbourne. He was on holiday celebrating his 67th birthday and 35th wedding anniversary with wife Susan and family. Auer was chief meteorologist at the MetService from 1990 until 1998, when Professor Auer became TV3's weekday weather presenter and the network's resident meteorologist in 2002. Professor Auer recently became involved in the debate over global warming, helping in 2006 to found the New Zealand Climate Science Coalition, a group that questions claims humanity is responsible for rising temperatures The coalition was chaired by retired Rear Admiral Jack Welch and made up of 13 scientists, including Prof Auer, Professor Bob Carter and Associate Professor Chris de Freitas. The group believed the public was being given incomplete, inaccurate and biased information about the effects of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. It called for a Royal Commission to investigate climate change. Professor Augie Auer is survived by his wife, three children and five grandchildren. \n",

      " Reactions to review of economic implications of climate change. Reactions to the review of the economic implications of climate change include optimism about the commercial opportunities and apprehension about possible fiscal repercussions. The Stern Review of the Economics of Climate Change, commissioned by the British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, points to the need for urgent action to reduce carbon emissions if a world-wide economic catastrophe is to be avoided. The institution of global carbon trading, control of deforestation, increased investment in energy R & D and support to poorer countries in adapting to climate change are all key proposals in the Review. A leaked letter from David Miliband, Environment Secretary, to Chancellor Brown contains a package of tax proposals to promote the use of public transport and to encourage people to buy smaller cars and fly less. The proposals also include charges on petrol-guzzling cars, road pricing, levies on air travel and increased charges for landfill waste disposal. The findings of the Review and the promise of a Government Climate Bill, containing measures in response to the Review, received a mixed reception from employers and unions. Miles Templeman, Director-General of the Institute of Directors, said: \"Without countries like the US, China or India making decisive commitments, UK competitiveness will undoubtedly suffer if we act alone. This would be bad for business, bad for the economy and ultimately bad for our climate.\" The Confederation of British Industries, the British Chambers of Commerce and asset managers F&C all pointed out the dangers to business of additional taxation. Brendan Barber, General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress, was optimistic about the opportunities for industry to meet demands created by investment in technology to combat climate change. The Prince of Wales' Corporate Leaders Group on Climate Change, formed by  14 of UK's leading companies shared this hope. Chairman of Shell UK, James Smith, expressed the hope of the group that business and Government would discuss how Britain could obtain \"first mover advantage\" in what he described as \"massive new global markets.\" The markets for low-carbon energy products are expected to be worth £300 billion by 2050. Nigel Farage, leader of the UK Independence Party, questions the assertions that there is scientific consensus on global warming. At best, he said, there is uncertainty. Politicians world-wide are jumping on the ‘green' bandwagon, but, if they want popular support, they'd better be sure that this is not simply the ‘new witchcraft'. Ruth Lea, Director of the Centre for Policy Studies, also questions the notion that there is a ‘scientific consensus' over global warming. She alleges that \"authorities on climate science say that the climate system is far too complex for modest reductions in one of the thousands of factors involved in climate change (i.e. carbon emissions) to have a predictable effect in magnitude, or even direction.\" About economic models, upon which Stern relied for his projections, her experience was that forecasting just two or three years ahead was usually wrong. She described the problem of drawing conclusions from combining scientific and economic models as ‘monumentally complex'. She doubted whether international cooperation was really possible. She concluded that she thought that this Review was designed to cloak the motives of a government that wanted some moral justification for increasing taxation on fuels. An unconfirmed report on BBC 24 early Tuesday morning, October 31, stated that the White House had not yet seen a copy of the Stern Review. In response to the Stern Report Australia's Prime Minister John Howard promised a AU$60 million to fight climate change. The projects are part of the Asia-Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. \"The Asia-Pacific Partnership includes countries that represent about half of the world's emissions, energy use, GDP (gross domestic product) and population, and is an important initiative that engages, for the first time, the key greenhouse-gas emitting countries in the Asia-Pacific region,\" Mr Howard said in a statement. A statement by Australian Greens senators Rachel Siewert and Christine Milne criticised the Australian Bureau of Agriculture and Resource Economics saying \"ABARE indicated that the type of research undertaken for the Stern Report is beyond them. They can put a price on what ratifying the Kyoto protocol would cost but have no idea or capacity to put a price on the cost of not acting. They are tinkering around the edges of the problem and don't seem to know whether climate change is real or whether there is any urgency.\" \n",

      " CanadaVOTES: NDP candidate Anne Lagacé Dowson in Westmount—Ville-Marie. In an attempt to speak with as many candidates as possible during the 2008 Canadian federal election, Wikinews has talked via email with Anne Lagacé Dowson. Dowson is a candidate in Quebec's Westmount—Ville-Marie riding, running under the New Democratic Party (NDP) banner. There is no incumbent in Dowson's riding, as the area's Liberal MP resigned earlier this year. A by-election was scheduled, but cancelled at the last minute, once Prime Minister Stephen Harper called a national election. Candidates in the riding are Dowson (NDP), former astronaut Marc Garneau (Liberal), Charles Larivée (Bloc Québécois), Guy Dufort (Conservative), and co-deputy party leader for the Greens Claude William Genest. Judith Vienneau of the joke party Neorhino.ca is also on the ballot. The riding includes the City of Westmount, parts of Old Montreal, the Borough of Ville-Marie, Notre-Dame-de-Grâce, and The Plateau. The following is an interview with Ms. Dowson, conducted via email. The interview is published unedited, as sent to Wikinews. Why are you running for political office, why at the federal level, why this party, and why in this riding? Incumbents: Why did you choose to run for office, and why do you wish to continue as an MP? Previous to this campaign, have you been politically involved? How will you apply your for those concerns in Ottawa. As you campaign around your riding, it's likely that some issues are mentioned more often by voters, than other issues. What would you say are the three hottest topics this election, in your riding? What would you and your party do to address these issues? There are more ways than ever to get your message out, from the traditional campaign fliers and lawn signs, to new media like websites, Facebook, and YouTube. The tried-and-true routes get the message out to the masses much easier, but digital alternatives are much more measurable in how many are seeing or interacting with your campaign. What seems to be the most effective, from your experience? \n",

      " Hopes for treaty on climate begin to wither. International climate negotiations for a global climate treaty are not producing the required results in the given amount of time left before the Copenhagen conference in December, diminishing the hopes for a resolution at this conference. Major polluters have already decided that the only way for a plan of this scale to take effect is to have steps towards the reduction of greenhouse gases instead of creating a plan which takes immediate effect and shuts down production facilities.  Countries are likely to propose steps at the Copenhagen Meeting. Yvo De Boer, a Dutch Diplomat, has been overseeing the proceedings so far. \"There isn't sufficient time to get the whole thing done. But I hope it will go well beyond simply a declaration of principles. The form I would like it to take is the groundwork for a ratifiable agreement next year,\" commented Boer. The 192 countries which make up the United Nations show the gaps in-between their ideas. Wealthier nations are planning to help poorer countries with enforcing climate laws and investing in newer technology. 16 of the largest polluters have already begun planning on aiding poorer countries. Officials are attempting to narrow down issues which countries agree on, such as certain steps and the common goal to limit emissions. Negotiators plan to discuss how the treaty will be upheld at Copenhagen. Diplomats have raised the question of reliability, since most of the supporting countries have not enforced any binding climate legislation within their own countries. Until it is shown that all countries participating will uphold the treaty, nations are unwilling to enforce a treaty within their own country. Although there are hopes of progress in Copenhagen, observes note that radical change is unlikely. \"The most likely form any agreement will take will be a political declaration,\" said Nigel Purvis, State Department climate negotiator during the Clinton Administration and Bush administration. \n",

      " Australia records hottest year on record. Australia has officially recorded its warmest year on record. According to the Bureau of Meteorology, (BOM) 2005 was the hottest year since reliable, widespread temperature observations became available in 1910. Data collected by the Bureau  show Australia's annual mean temperature for 2005 was 1.09°C above the standard 1961-90 average. The Bureau of Meteorology says the result is more evidence of climate change. The Bureau's Blair Trewin said: \"We've seen things like the general retreat of the winter snow line. We've seen a marked decrease in the frequency of frost, especially in inland Queensland,\" Dr Trewin said. \"We've seen an increase in the number of extreme hot days.\" And the warming trend is likely to continue. \"All the projections we have from climate models we would expect to see continued warming through the 21st century,\" he said. \"Numbers like this ... are another piece of evidence that climate change is real and it's a real issue.\" Despite unseasonably cool weather in the South West of Western Australia, 2005 was a hot year over most of the nation, with the Northern Territory (NT) bearing the brunt. The NT area-average maximum temperature was 1.45°C above the long-term mean, the largest anomaly of any state or territory. The previous record of +0.84°C was set in 1998. The Bureau says that while these temperature departures may seem relatively small, a 1°C increase in mean temperatures is equivalent to many southern Australian towns shifting northward by about 100km. All States and Territories, apart from Victoria and Tasmania, recorded 2005 mean temperatures amongst their top two warmest years on record. The only region recording a cooler than normal year was a coastal strip of Western Australia extending from Cape Leeuwin to Carnarvon. Australia's previous warmest years on record were influenced by significant El Niño events, say the Bureau. However, no such event occurred in 2005, making the record warmth even more unusual. Since 1979, all but four years have been warmer than average in Australia. Australian temperatures have increased by approximately 0.9ºC since 1910 - consistent with global warming trends. Scientific studies have linked global and Australian temperature increases to the enhanced greenhouse effect. The early months of 2005 were also very dry over much of Australia with the January-May period being the 2nd driest on record. Australia's area-averaged rainfall is calculated from a network of around 5000 rainfall stations. Observations from this network reveal that, when compared to historical records, Tasmania was the wettest State in 2005, while Queensland and Western Australia were the driest. Over the New Year bushfires have caused havoc in many parts of Australia, with houses, farm stock devastated. Thousands of hectares of bushland and farmland have been burnt out. Environmentalists say the weather is a precursor of things to come: \"2005 gave us a little taste of what life will be like if we fail to tackle climate change,\" Greenpeace's Catherine Fitzpatrick said. \"The extreme heat and bushfires of New Year's Day 2006 showed that it isn't going to be fun. If action isn't taken soon to avoid catastrophic climate change, Australians will have John Howard to blame for failing to act when he had the chance.\" Ms Fitzpatrick said the Federal Government was as beholden to the coal and aluminium industries as the Japanese government was to whaling companies, and with far more devastating impacts. \"Today's figures should spur our Environment Minister ... to real action – ratify Kyoto, quit coal and move towards clean, renewable energy,\" Ms Fitzpatrick said. The Howard government claims it is taking appropriate action. Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell said he recognised climate change was the biggest modern-day environmental challenge. \"I think that climate change is alarming,\" he said on ABC radio. \"I regard climate change as the number one environmental challenge ... It is a huge and serious challenge. These figures add to the weight of evidence that climate change is real and it's a problem that the world needs to work together to seek to solve.\" Australia and the United States are the only developed nations to have refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol, which calls on countries to cut greenhouse emissions by 5.2 per cent below 1990 levels by 2012. The Government argues Kyoto will not work because it does not commit developing nations to reducing emissions. \"Kyoto excludes most of the emissions in the world. It only covers just over a third of the countries of the world and ... we need something that includes all countries of the world,\" said Senator Campbell. Many regions across the globe also reported an exceptionally warm year. According to a preliminary estimate released by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), the global mean temperature for 2005 was about 0.48°C above normal, putting 2005 amongst the four warmest years globally since records commenced in 1861. \n",

      " John Howard sets green energy targets. Australian Prime Minister John Howard has announced a national \"Clean Energy Target\". The target requires that by 2020, 30,000 gigawatt hours of electricity each year comes from low emissions sources. The plan is an attempt to consolidate the different state-based targets. \"What this initiative will do is gather up all of the different state schemes, many of which are contradictory or at the very least dissimilar,\" Mr Howard said. The announcement was criticised by Labor environment spokesman Peter Garrett. \"This is just piggybacking on the hard work of state Labor governments,\" Mr Garrett said. \"The Howard Government has an appalling record on renewable energy and cannot be trusted to deliver on this commitment. The Greens pointed out that the target did not take account of an increase in demand. “Under the Prime Minister’s target, greenhouse gas emissions from the electricity sector will blow out to be 44% higher than the present day, because this feeble addition of low emission technology won’t be able to keep pace with growth in electricity demand,\" said Greens Senate candidate Scott Ludlam. \n",

      " PM John Howard's nuclear push causes alarm. Australian Prime Minister John Howard has announced he wants a \"full-scale nuclear debate\", and three of his senior federal government frontbenchers - Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, Resources Minister, Ian Macfarlane, and Environment Minister Ian Campbell - have all suggested Australia, which has around 40 per cent of the world's known uranium reserves, should consider enriching uranium - a step in processing that would allow it to be used as reactor fuel as well as for nuclear weapons. However there is strong opposition for nuclear power in the Australian community. The Australian Greens have rejected the Prime Minister's assumption that nuclear power might be 'desirable' for Australia. The Greens say they challenge Mr Howard to show \"true leadership on climate change and nuclear non-proliferation.\" Greens climate change and energy spokesperson Senator Christine Milne said Mr Howard was \"playing politics\" by floating the idea and testing public opinion before developing a government position. \"Instead of pandering to US President George Bush and UK Prime Minister Tony Blair - the two most unpopular leaders in the world today - Prime Minister Howard should demonstrate real leadership and put some authenticity into the government's response to climate change and terrorism,\" Senator Milne said. \"Nuclear power and nuclear proliferation are a threat to both.\" Senator Milne challenged advocates of nuclear power to explain what they will to do about nuclear waste, how large a public subsidy they are prepared to pay to prop up nuclear power, and why the Sustainable Development Commission was wrong when it recommended last month against expanding nuclear power in Britain. \"Australians have already had to subsidise uranium mining companies to clean up after mines have closed, while last week's Budget papers revealed that ANSTO can't estimate the cost of decommissioning the Lucas Heights nuclear reactor,\" Senator Milne said. \"When will advocates of nuclear power admit that it is too slow, too expensive and too dangerous to be a solution to climate change? Nor is there any safe way to dispose of the waste. It is not even safe to transport, a concern supported by the head of the International Energy Agency...\" said Senator Milne in a media release. \"Instead of turning to nuclear power, Australia should ratify the Kyoto Protocol, invest in renewable energy, adopt a national energy efficiency target and improve public transport. \"Several studies examining options to achieve deep cuts in Australian greenhouse emissions all show this goal can be achieved, cost effectively, without resorting to nuclear power,\" said Senator Milne in a media release. Greens leader Bob Brown says the Prime Minister is sending a message of approval for Indonesia to become a nuclear power. \"Australia and our region are essentially nuclear-free. Mr Howard is abandoning that security to grab uranium profits and facilitate an Australian role in nuclear enrichment,\" Senator Brown said. \"This robs Australia of its moral strength to argue against Indonesia resurrecting the Soeharto plan for 12 nuclear reactors and to advance its interest in Russian-built floating nuclear power stations.\" \"This will make our region much less secure for the next generation of Australians,\" Senator Brown said. \"John Howard has talked up regional terrorism. Now he is promoting nuclear power proliferation in our neighbourhood. At best his logic is faulty, at worst he is taking Australia into a future unnecessarily menaced by the nuclear threat,\" Senator Brown said. Labor MP Kelvin Thomson says John Howard's push towards nuclear power generation could heighten the risk of a terrorist attack. \"The problem with nuclear power is that more of it that is around, the easier it is for terrorists to get access to it and I'm not satisfied that in this day and age we can be absolutely certain that terrorists can't access it,\" Mr Thomson said. Mr Thompson said the Government should be focussing its interest on \"much safer and environmentally-friendly\" abundant renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar power. Mr Thomson said Australia was a potential world-leader in solar power. \"Surely you exhaust all the other alternatives first before you say let's go down the nuclear road,\" he said. \"The problem with nuclear power is that more of it that is around, the easier it is for terrorists to get access to it,\" he said. \"I'm not satisfied that in this day and age you can be absolutely certain that terrorists can't access it.\" Union leader Bill Shorten, a federal Labor candidate at the next election, believes the issue is unpopular with the electorate. A survey in 2005 found 47 percent of Australians supported nuclear power and 40 percent opposed it. Professor Frank Muller from the University of New South Wales, said the framework to manage nuclear power needs to be put in place first. He says it could take decades before a nuclear power plant could operate. \"So it actually takes even longer to provide a greenhouse benefit than it does to build a power plant,\" he said. Professor Muller says nuclear power stations are expensive to build, and safety is a major issue. Opposition environment spokesman Anthony Albanese said: \"John Howard's nuclear fantasy is Australia's nightmare,\" Mr Albanese told reporters. \"Intractable problems with nuclear energy when it comes to economic costs, safety, disposal of waste and contribution to nuclear proliferation remain up to some 50 years.\" Mr Albanese said that if Mr Howard was serious about nuclear power he should say where a nuclear power plant would be built, and where the waste it produced would be stored. \"If he's so confident that nuclear energy is safe... I'm sure he'll have coalition MPs volunteering to have a nuclear reactor in their electorate and to store their waste in the electorate,\" he said. Mr Albanese said the current Labor policy remained opposed to nuclear energy in Australia. \n",

      " Australian nuclear power plants rejected by states. Australian media reports that Prime Minister John Howard is expected to push a nuclear energy inquiry through federal cabinet this week. Meanwhile, a list of possible sites for nuclear reactors has been leaked by the Opposition to media. The locations, listed in 1997, include Adelaide, Darwin, Perth, Lucas Heights, Goulburn, Holsworthy, and Broken Hill in New South Wales and other sites. West Australian (WA) premier Alan Carpenter says the list of fourteen potential sites were a \"facade to soften up Western Australians into accepting a nuclear waste dump.\" The WA Premier said people would not only be surprised but \"stunned to learn that the federal cabinet considered possible sites... without disclosing them to any state government.\" Mr Carpenter said in a media release that the document mentions a site near Perth airport. \"People should wake up to what's happening around Australia, particularly in WA,\" said Mr. Carpenter. \"Only a few weeks ago, we had three prominent WA Liberal MPs supporting a nuclear waste dump in WA,\" he said. \"This is all a facade in the Howard Government's push to soften up West Australians for a nuclear waste dump.\" Premier Carpenter, whose Labor government stridently opposes uranium mining in WA, stated his opposition to a nuclear waste dump: \"I vehemently oppose the prospect of our State becoming the dumping ground for the world's nuclear waste and that is what will happen if we allow uranium mining in WA. The evidence is mounting and indisputable.\" The South Australian Government has ruled out any possible nuclear power plant in SA. \"A nuclear power plant would bankrupt our state,\" SA Premier Mike Rann said.  \"It would not be commercially viable and would not, in my view, be acceptable to the public.  Nuclear power plants need giant populations to sustain them, there is no-one coming to me from the commercial sector or the mining industry or anywhere else, suggesting a nuclear power plant.\" Earlier, Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said South Australia should build a nuclear power station to run a desalination plant. Premier Rann dismissed the idea as ridiculous and said comments by Mr Downer highlight divisions within Federal Cabinet. He said Mr Downer is at odds with the Federal Finance Minister Nick Minchin, who says the high costs of nuclear power would rule it out. Mr Rann says South Australia will not allow nuclear power. \"For once I'm agreeing with Nick Minchin,\" he said. \"I think Nick Minchin is right that a nuclear power plant isn't necessary and won't happen and I think that Alexander Downer is having a bit of a lend of him.\" Victoria's Energy Minister Theo Theophanous said nuclear energy in Australia did not make sense when the cost and problems of waste disposal were considered. Mr Theophanous has rejected a report that found nuclear power could be competitive with conventional energy generation if it was subsided with help from a taxpayer subsidy. A recent report found nuclear power could compete with gas or coal-fired electricity if taxpayers helped to pay for it or shouldered the risk of its production. The ANSTO report found nuclear plants could be built in the next 10 to 15 years and an Australian version would cost about $2.5 billion to establish. To make it viable, taxpayers would pay hundreds of million towards start-up costs, said the report. But Mr Theophanous said Victoria had already had concluded the nuclear proposal did not add up. \"I had my department look at this and provide a report to me more than a year ago in relation to the prospect of nuclear power,\" he said. \"The problem is a commercial one as much as anything else. It costs roughly double the price to produce power out of nuclear energy. If you're going to pay double the price, why not put in wind farms? Why not use renewable energy, which is even cheaper than nuclear energy?\" said Mr Theophanous . The Victoria Government urges householders to reduce greenhouse emissions by reducing daily energy consumption. A new campaign identifies simple measures residents can adopt to cut power bills and greenhouse emissions, including turning the heating thermostat to no more than 20C, washing clothes in cold water and turning appliances off at the switch when they are not being used. New South Wales Premier Morris Iemma has also declared his opposition to nuclear power. He said no nuclear power stations would be built in NSW as long as he is premier. Mr Iemma urged state opposition leader Peter Debnam to join him in opposing the construction of nuclear power plants in NSW. \"While ever I'm premier of NSW there won't be any nuclear power plants in NSW,\" he told reporters. Queensland Premier Peter Beattie says he \"would not jeopardize the state's coal industry by supporting a nuclear power plant.\" Mr. Beattie has ruled out uranium mining in Queensland to protect the state's huge coal industry. He said he would not support a nuclear power plant. \"The State Government would not support it,\" Mr. Beattie said. \"We have the power to block them and we would block them, we would not support nuclear power. Why would we have a nuclear reactor in competition with the coal industry?\" Mr. Beattie told media. The Australian Conservation Foundation (ACF) chairman Don Henry says a nuclear debate must consider climate change. \"If the inquiry is just about nuclear power it will be a waste of taxpayers money because nuclear power is too dangerous, too dirty, and too slow to tackle climate change,\" he said. \"If the inquiry is going to be fairdinkum, it needs to look at that issue: what can we do right now to tackle climate change in Australia?\" Australian Greens climate change and energy spokesperson Senator Christine Milne said in a media release: \"Instead of turning to nuclear power, Australia should ratify the Kyoto Protocol, invest in renewable energy, adopt a national energy efficiency target and improve public transport. \"Several studies examining options to achieve deep cuts in Australian greenhouse emissions all show this goal can be achieved, cost effectively, without resorting to nuclear power.\" Greens Senator Rachel Siewert says: \"The nuclear industry is engaged in a concerted effort to be given one last chance for redemption... yet every step of the nuclear fuel chain, from mining, milling, enrichment and operating reactors to waste storage, is subject to the same human error, material breakdowns, complexity and incompetence as any other area of human endeavour.\" said Senator Siewert. \"The current inventory of nuclear waste will already present our descendents with a monstrous intergenerational headache. Allowing so much as a kilogram more of this material to be produced is simply immoral.\" The ACF say \"nuclear energy is not a solution to climate change.\" ACF President Professor Ian Lowe says \"Nuclear is too slow to provide any legitimate answer to climate change or to energy security for the developing world.\" The ACF report that, as an energy source globally, uranium provides less power than renewables do. \"Uranium is inextricably linked to very serious environmental and health problems via nuclear weapons and radioactive waste. There is nothing ideological about opposing its use...\" The Australian Newspaper reports that Prime Minister Howard is preparing to appoint chief scientist Jim Peacock, a supporter of nuclear power, and other high-level nuclear industry experts to the team. The public inquiry, to be undertaken by three or four selected experts is expected to \"examine the economics of nuclear energy, health, safety, environmental and proliferation issues as well as waste and storage.\" The taskforce will take submissions and is expected to prepare a report to Government within four or five months, with the Government's response early in 2007. The Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation (ANSTO), Ian Smith, says \"at least three\" power plants would be required.  Mr Howard said the ANSTO report challenged the view that the cost of nuclear power was prohibitive.  Dr Smith told a Senate estimates hearing that Australia would require \"multiple power stations to make the industry viable\". Federal Industry Minister Ian Macfarlane said the nuclear energy inquiry would also include consideration of nuclear enrichment plants in Australia. Mr Macfarlane said he would consider a nuclear power plant in his own Toowoomba electorate. Prime Minister John Howard insisted he would not be deterred by the unpopularity of nuclear power. \n",

      " Warmest global winter on record according to NOAA. Although the United States experienced average temperatures for the December, 2006 to February, 2007 period, overall world temperatures were the warmest on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In a March 15, 2007 report, the NOAA indicated that a record warm January helped push the combined global land and ocean surface temperature for the past winter to its highest value since records began in 1880. The ocean-atmosphere system, El Niño, played a part in the season’s record warmth, according to the report's authors, but its effects did not last long, as ocean temperatures in the central equatorial Pacific cooled more than 0.3 degrees C in February and were near average for the month. The global land-surface temperature was the warmest on record, while the ocean-surface temperature tied for second warmest in the past 128 year period, approximately 0.06 degrees C cooler than the record established during the strong El Niño episode of 1997-1998. During the past century, global surface temperatures have increased approximately 0.06 degrees C per decade, but since 1976 the rate of increase has been about 0.18 degrees C per decade. The greatest temperature increase occurred in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. In an interview with Reuters, Jay Lawrimore of NOAA suggested that the data does not show greenhouse gases had an influence on the recent temperature increases, but acknowledges that by \"looking at long-term trends and long-term changes, we are able to better understand natural and anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change.\" A U.S. Commerce Department agency based in Washington, D.C., the NOAA conducts research and gathers data on oceans and atmosphere. The NOAA is a participant in the Group on Earth Observations, GEO, an intergovernmental effort to coordinate the collection of Earth observations worldwide. \n",

The United Food and Commercial Workers International Union broke away from the American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations (AFL-CIO), making it the third union to split from the AFL-CIO this week over disagreements about how to revive labor's diminishing influence. The departure of the UFCW, along with two other unions, theTeamsters, and Service Employees International unions from the AFL-CIO means it is losing more than 4 million of its 13 million members. Union membership in the U.S. has been declining for many years, and the breakaway unions want to commit more money to recruiting members. They complain that the AFL-CIO has spent too much money on backing political candidates, particularly Democrats, instead of organizing labor. UFCW President Joe Hansen wrote to AFL-CIO President John J. Sweeney saying: \"Tradition and past success are not sufficient to meet the new challenges.\" AFL-CIO spokeswoman Lane Windham responded, saying \"The UFCW leadership decision to leave the AFL-CIO, especially when working people are up against the most powerful, anti-worker corporate and governmental forces in 80 years, is a tragedy for working families. Only unions' enemies win when unions split our strength.\" \"The unions that split from the AFL-CIO now face the challenge of having to work together to maximize the power of labor,\" predicted Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor issues at UC Berkley. Their clearest difference is in how they want a national labor organization to operate, Shaiken said. The breakaway unions favor a more authoritative federation that can compel member unions to act on its directives. The departure is part of the biggest rift in organized labor since 1938, when the CIO split from the AFL. When the groups merged to form the AFL-CIO in the 1950s, one of every three private-sector workers belonged to a labor union. Today, fewer than 8 percent of private-sector workers are unionized. \n",

      " US Interior Department approves Willow oil project in Alaska. The US Department of the Interior approved ConocoPhillips' Willow oil drill proposal in Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska (NPR–A) on March 13. The Department revoked leases of 68,000 acres (275 square kilometers) of land within the Bear Tooth Unit, in the northeast NPR–A, and granted three of ConocoPhillips' requested five drill sites. According to the Department's record of decision, the approved version of the plan \"requires the fewest ice roads, fewest total miles of infield pipelines, least water use, fewest vehicle trips, fewest fixed-wing aircraft trips, fewest helicopter trips, and fewest acres of screeding.\" US Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, tweeted the same day: \"I'm so relieved that an economically viable Willow Project is being reapproved. What a huge and needed victory for all Alaska.\" According to a January Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement (SEIS) published by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), a Department of the Interior agency, the project would: destroy approximately 532 acres (2 km²) of wetlands; use approximately 1.5 billion gallons (5.7 billion liters) of freshwater; and emit approximately 613 trillion pounds (278,036 metric megatons) of gross carbon dioxide equivalent over its 30-year planned duration. Development of the master plan for the project began in 2018. The BLM released its EIS on August 15, 2020; Audubon Alaska and several other indigenous and conservation organizations stated in a joint press release the same day: \"Rather than listening to local communities and taking the necessary time to produce an adequate analysis, the [then-president Donald] Trump Administration is rushing ahead to meet ConocoPhillips' timeline—driven by their desire to have rubber-stamped permits in hand before a potential administration change.\" The Department of the Interior released a Record of Decision on October 26, 2020 authorizing up to three drill sites as well as supporting infrastructure such as processing and support facilities, gravel access roads, and pipelines. Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt said then: \"This decision will make a significant contribution to keeping oil flowing down the 800-mile Trans Alaska Pipeline decades into the future while delivering federal and state revenue as well as important impact assistance to the affected native communities.\" On February 13, 2021, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit granted a temporary injunction preventing ConocoPhillips from blasting, building roads, and gravel mining for the Willow project. On August 18, 2021, the US District Court in Anchorage reversed the August 2020 EIS, finding it did not analyze foreign greenhouse gas emissions, include alternative proposals not subscribing to the conclusion that leases afforded the right to extract \"all possible\" oil and gas from each lease tract, and failed to properly consider the Naval Petroleum Reserves Production Act (NPRPA)'s requirement to give \"maximum protection\" to 'surface values' in the Teshekpuk Lake Special Area (TLSA). In January 2021, US President Joe Biden signed an executive order that paused \"new oil and natural gas leases on public lands or in offshore waters\", a campaign promise of his. In June 2021, US District Judge Terry A. Doughty granted a preliminary injunction blocking the administration's pause; last August, Doughty made the injunction permanent, stating the administration lacked \"the authority to implement a Stop of lease sales.\" The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA) required the US Department of Interior to lease the lesser of 60 million acres (240,000 km²) offshore and 2 million acres (8,100 km²) of federal lands each year for oil and gas development and the amount requisitioned by industry. The Willow project was supported by a group of Alaska Native organizations and all three members of Alaska's bipartisan congressional delegation, who argued it is economically critical for their communities. US Senator Dan Sullivan, also an Alaska Republican, said the project would be \"one of the biggest, most important resource development projects in our state's history.\" On February 20, the Alaska House of Representatives passed House Joint Resolution 6 by 36–0, expressing support for the project. However, Sierra Club Senior Campaign Representative Mike Scott said: \"The Willow project would have a devastating effect on public lands and our climate, and approving it after passing the largest climate bill in history would be a giant step in reverse.\" \n",

      " Australia's \"most powerful\" windfarm approved. The government of Victoria has announced plans to build what it says will be Australia's \"most powerful wind farm.\" Planning Minister Rob Hulls has given the go ahead to a new $380 million wind farm at Mount Gellibrand in the state's south-west. \"I'm pleased to announce that I have approved Australia's most powerful and Victoria's largest wind farm to date,\" Mr Hulls said. \"This project is expected to create anywhere between 110 and 120 jobs during construction and up to 25 full time positions during the life of the wind farm,\" he said. The massive wind farm will be located 120 km west of Melbourne, close to the regional centre of Colac. The wind farm comprises 116 turbines of the 2 MW class - with an overall capacity of 232 MW. The wind farm will produce over 700,000 MWh annually of clean energy which is enough to supply approximately 132,000 Victorian households. German company Pro Ventum International is undertaking the project Minister Hulls said only nine objections had been lodged against the project. Local landowner Tim Gore, who plans to have 32 turbines on his property, said he was not concerned about potential noise from the turbines. Pro Ventum International say they will commence work on an Environmental Management report the next few weeks. Wind farm critic Tim Le Roy said there was no environmental benefit from the project at all and the Victorian government would better spend its money on geo-thermal energy. The turbines, each 125 metres tall, will be visible from the Princes Highway between Geelong and Colac, sited at the foot of Mount Gellibrand. In October last year, Colac Otway council's chief executive officer, Tracey Slatter, said the proposal would benefit the shire: \"...we're looking at reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and with the demand of energy set to increase it is important that we do consider these renewable energy sources,\" she said. \n",

Extreme high heat and dry conditions are serving to create the potential for excessive wildfires across much of Texas, according to officials. On Tuesday, a report citing officials with the Texas A&M Forest Service, noted that even though thunderstorms are predicted this week, lightning from those storms could spark ignitions of fire. Between July 8 and July 10, forty-three new wildfires were recorded across the state. The report also noted the potential is high for wildfires to erupt near the cities of Athens, Tyler, Longview, Palestine and Huntsville. Also on Tuesday, temperatures in the city of Tyler hovered at 102 °F (38.9 °C) for most of the afternoon. As of Wednesday, the National Weather Service has a heat advisory in place across portions of southern Texas. \n",

      " Zimbabwe may face famine due to wilting crops, organisation says. The US-funded Famine Early Warning System Network (FEWSNET) has said that Zimbabwe may face famine this year, due to wilting crops caused by poor rains. The organisation added that more than two million Zimbabweans would require food aid between now and March. “Since December, below-average precipitation and above-average temperatures continue to help strengthen seasonal moisture deficits across central Mozambique, southern Malawi, southern Madagascar and southern Zimbabwe,” FEWSNET said. FEWSNET remarked that low amounts and rainfall, coupled with high temperatures, could result in crop failures in regions like Masvingo, Gwanda, Bulawayo and part of Manicaland. It also said that the World Food Programme is intending to increase food aid measures in the country. FEWSNET's estimate for the number of food-insecure people in Zimbabwe is now at 2.2 million, above the 1.7 million estimate for October through December. \n",

      " Researchers discover high temperature enables more efficient hydrogen generation. A more efficient way to produce useable hydrogen has been demonstrated by researchers. It uses very high-temperature electrolysis to separate hydrogen from water, so that hydrogen may be used for energy production. Electrolysis is one method by which laboratories and factories produce hydrogen. An electrical current is passed through water, breaking it down into hydrogen and oxygen gas, which are then collected above the water reservoir. Researchers in Salt Lake City, Utah, at Ceramtech Incorporated, in collaboration with workers at The Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory report that when water is superheated to 800 degrees Celsius, far less electricity is required to produce the same volume of hydrogen. The researchers envision that future nuclear fission plants could be used both to heat the water as part of their cooling system, and generate the needed electricity. Concerns have been raised regarding the safety of such arrangements, however.  Jeremy Desterhoft, an independent consultant on nuclear energy safety, warns the \"elevated levels of radiation required to sufficiently lower the atomic separation point is beyond the current capabilities of any recent cooler.\"  He does not believe that economically viable cooling technology will be available for at least four to six more years. \n",

      " Snow causes disruption in UK. Heavy snow has caused disruption in the United Kingdom with airports and schools closed and delays on the road network. Snowfall was highest near Worcester with 9cms of snow falling.  The snow has caused hundreds of school closures and major disruption to airports with Birmingham, London Gatwick and City, Bristol and Cardiff runways closing although these have now re-opened.  However the runways at Luton and Stanstead remain closed due to the bad weather. The road network has also been affected with some snow settling and accidents occurring causing major congestion in some areas, althought gritting by the Highways Agency and local authorities has limited the effect on trunk roads and motorways. Schools were closed in Birmingham, Solihull and Dudley, while some remained open in Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, East Anglia and Wales, Shropshire, Staffordshire and Cheshire. Drivers are being warned that driving conditions will continue to be adverse and are being advised only to travel if absolutely necessary. Train services by Midland Mainline and Virgin as well as the London Underground are affected, with delays, reduced services and cancellations. The overall economic effect of the snow is predicted to cost the British economy approximately £400 million due to loss of work hours. There has also been loss of power in some areas of Wales including Abergaveny, Llandeilo and Blaenporth. The snow fall is expected to continue into the evening but may turn to sleet in some areas.  Also cold temperature tonight will mean that there is a high chance of ice forming on the road network. Up to 15 cm of snow is expected through the day in some hilly areas but wetter and milder weather is expected over the weekend. \n",

The massive surge of hot air that has plagued the West and Midwest during last week has now moved over the eastern seaboard of the United States. Residents are bracing themselves for what could be record breaking temperatures. Many cities are already struggling due to power outages from mid-July's Heat Wave, particularly some in the Queens and Staten Island in New York City. Consolidated Edison, the power supplier for the New York City area, has reported that many customers are still without power. They urge customers to lighten the load on power usage to help avoid further service interruption. Baltimore, Washington D.C. and Philadelphia are all expecting highs to reach above 100ºF (37.8ºC). The National Weather Service has posted Excessive Heat Warnings for many of the cities in the eastern seaboard that do not normally experience this type of dangerously hot weather. On Tuesday August 1, 2006 according to The Weather Channel, New York City will have a high temperature of 98ºF in Central Park, however other areas in the New York City area are expected to rise above 100ºF. Philadelphia will reach 100ºF, Washington D.C. will have a high of 101ºF and Baltimore and Richmond may see temperatures rise above the 100 mark. To exacerbate the situation, heat indices are expected to reach well over the 110s for much of the east coast due to high humidity levels. An Air Stagnation Advisory has also been issued for much of the urban areas on the eastern seaboard and \"BosWash\", as rain is expected to be very minimal through Thursday. Many residents say this heat is unheard of as temperatures are expected to be higher than that of Florida and some parts of Texas, where it is typically hotter. The oppressive and dangerously high temperatures will remain this way well into Thursday afternoon, according to meteorologists, when a cool front is expected to move in and provide much needed relief. \n",

Most of the U.S. state of Florida is sweltering in summerlike heat and humidity ahead of a cold front, which promises to bring down polar air from Canada to cool down the state next week. A wide swath of Florida has reported temperatures above 90º Fahrenheit (32º Celsius) over the last three days, with heat indices either approaching or topping 100ºF (38º C), with similar conditions persisting into the weekend. At the Tampa Vandenberg Airport yesterday, few clouds and south-southwest winds pushed the temperature to 93º (34º C), toppling the previous record set for that date (89º in 1993). At the Tampa International Airport, the recorded high was 88º (31º C), just one degree shy of the record set on that date, also in 1993. Record-breaking highs were also witnessed yesterday at the Orlando International Airport: the recorded high was 93º, breaking the record of 91º set back in 1980. In downtown Jacksonville, the recorded high yesterday was 88º, three degrees shy of the record set in 1980, but still ten degrees higher than the average high for October 19. Even normally warm Miami flirted with record highs. On October 18, Miami recorded a high of 89º in downtown, one degree shy of the record high set back in 1993. The only part of the state receiving a respite from the high temperatures is the Panhandle, which is already feeling the effects of the nearly stationary cold front. \n",

High temperatures in the area reached 100ºF (~38ºC). Police said that the girl had been inside the car for hours before her death. A friend of the family said the child was Cecelia Slaby, however police are not reporting any personal information. The car was registered to the school's vice principal, Brenda Nesselroad-Slaby. The school staff had to report to work to prepare for the start of school next week. The family friend that identified the girl also told News 5 in Cincinnati that Nesselroad-Slaby was scheduled to attend a 7 a.m. meeting, but decided that was too early in the day to drop off Cecelia, so she ran several errands instead. The source said Cecelia likely fell asleep in the car and Nesselroad forgot about her when she did go to the school, as she usually does not care for the child in the morning. However, police have not released any specific details. The family friend described Nesselroad as \"mother of the year.\" The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration says the temperature inside a closed vehicle setting in sunlight can raise nearly 20 Fahrenheit degrees (11 Celsius degrees) in just three minutes. Another three or four minutes, and the administration says a car's temperature can reach 125ºF (~52ºC). Heatstrokes occur when the body reaches a temperature of 104ºF (40ºC).

      " 8.9 magnitude earthquake hits Japan, causes tsunami. A massive 8.9 magnitude earthquake occurred in northern Japan early on Friday.  The earthquake's epicenter is 130 km (81 miles) east of Sendai, in the Honshu island of Japan. According to the U.S. Geological Survey, the epicenter was at a depth of 24.4 km (15.2 miles). The earthquake triggered tsunamis in various parts of the country. Japan issued a tsunami warning immediately after the earthquake, followed by tsunami warnings for New Zealand, Australia, Russia, Chile, Guam, Philippines, Indonesia, Papua New Guinea, Nauru, Hawaii, Northern Marianas (USA), Taiwan, and California. It is confirmed for the Philippines that if the tsunami doesn't hit the country for 2 hours (5:00 - 7:00) it will be slightly safer, it is currently alert number two for all regions. The tsunami attained a height of 10 meters, and swept houses, buildings and cars according to reports. Shinkansen stopped the bullet train service following the quake. According to reports, an oil refinery was set ablaze by the quake at Ichihara, Chiba prefecture to the east of Tokyo. The National Weather Service said that earthquakes \"of this size\" often \"generate tsunamis potentially dangerous to coasts outside the source region.\" \"Based on all available data a tsunami may have been generated by this earthquake that could be destructive on coastal areas even far from the epicenter,\" it added. About 20 people were reportedly injured in Tokyo following the collapse of a roof of a hall. 4 million people are estimated to be without power in the capital. In Sendai, several people are feared to be buried under the remains of a collapsed hotel. Prime Minister Naoto Kan said there had been no nuclear plant radiation leaks caused by the disaster. He expressed sympathy to all victims in his address, promising help, and stating that an emergency response headquarters had been set up. 288 people have been confirmed dead so far. However, a 2-3 km area around the Fukushima Nuclear Power plant has been evacuated as a precaution as the temperature inside on of the nuclear reactor has \"remain[ed] at a high temperature\" despite the plant being shut down. Trade Minister Banri Kaieda advised that there is a possibility of a radiation leak at the plant. \n",

Embedded Journalist Darrin Mortenson, who was with U.S. troops during the operation in Fallujah, already reported in April 2004 that a mortar team leader \"directed his men to fire round after round of high explosives and white phosphorus charges into the city Friday and Saturday\". The U.S. State department initially denied that white phosphorus was used as weaponry, but Pentagon spokesman, Lt. Col. Barry Venable said white phosphorous munitions were used as an incendiary weapon against enemy combatants. \"It was not used against civilians,\" he said in a Tuesday briefing. Lt. Col. Venable repeated U.S. State department statements that white phosphorous munitions are a standard field artillery element. Up until at least April 2001 it was \"against the law of land warfare to employ WP against personnel targets\" according to the U.S. Army Battle Book. The Pentagon briefing directed reporters to the March-April 2005 edition of the U.S. Army's Field Artillery magazine, where veterans of the Fallujah action described their use of white phosphorous munitions to \"flush [insurgents] out\", and it use as a screening agent (providing smoke cover) and as \"a potent psychological weapon against the insurgents in trench lines.\" The 1980 Convention on Conventional Weapons (Protocol III), which the USA is not a signatory to, disallows the use of incendiary weapons against civilian populations or air attacks against troops stationed in a civilian population center, but does not outlaw its battlefield use. General George Casey's 8 November 2004 briefing estimated the number of civilians still in Fallujah as between 20,000 and 100,000 civilians. White phosphorous burns at temperatures near 5,000 degrees Fahrenheit (2760 C). It is used to start fires and can cause severe burns where it strikes humans. The Italian documentary showed photos of what it said were Iraqis who had been burned by the white phosphorous. The accepted lethal dose of white phosphorous is 1mg/kg. The smoke raises contentions for its battlefield use. It is primarily used as a \"marker\", as the high temperature combustion causes \"pillaring\" of the smoke column. But the smoke does contain phosphoric acid and traces of unburned phosphorous, which is corrosive to human tissue (internally and externally.) The US Army Field Manual cautions \"Phosphorous smoke produces phosphoric acid. Soldiers must wear respiratory protection, such as protective masks, if exposed to phosphorous smoke.\" \"Chemical weapons used in Iraq by US military, says Italian documentary\" — Wikinews, November 8, 2005 \n",

      " Wikinews international report: \"Anonymous\" holds anti-Scientology protests worldwide. The Internet group Project Chanology today held protests critical of the Church of Scientology. The protests marked what would have been the 49th birthday of Lisa McPherson, who is claimed to be a victim of the Church of Scientology's practices. Lisa died in 1995 during a running of what Scientologists refer to as an Introspection Rundown, a procedure intended to help Church members deal with a psychotic or deeply traumatic event. Protests were planned throughout the day in 14 countries and over 50 different cities. The estimation of total protesters world wide for Feb. 10, 2008 is 9,250 people. Wikinews had correspondents at a number of protest locations to report on the events. This article was updated throughout the day with reports from around the globe. About 150 anonymous protesters turned out in Adelaide to protest the Church of Scientology. Most wore masks, many also wearing suits or wigs. 200+ members of Anonymous gathered in Atlanta.  While riot police were called to the scene as well as the local media, only one incident occurred.  A person from the Anonymous crowd tried to enter the church to talk to them but police temporarily detained him.  He was later released without charges. Correspondent: Craig Russell Correspondent: TUFKAAP Protesters in Boston covered all four corners of the block surrounding the Church with 30-45 people on each side of the streets and corners. Most protesters ranged from 18 to 25 years old. Crowds soon swelled to numbers of about 250. The weather was of typical New England weather, where it quickly jumped from sunny weather at the start to slight drizzling rain then to a downpour and eventually a flurry that lasted about 15–20 minutes before dissipating. However, even that did not drive the protesters away. The protesters' meet up spot was Trinity Church in Boston's famed Copley Square right under the gaze of the John Hancock Building. After congregating protesters proceeded down to the local Scientology church and began their picket. An ex-Scientology member know as Larry Brennan showed up and said he applauded what \"Anonymous\" was doing. Meanwhile, a camera watched the protest from the top floor of the Scientology church looking at the protesters gathered below. Throughout the protest, each corner took turns shouting this chant \"Religion! Should! Be! Free!\" At the same time, cars honked in support for the protesters, including firemen of the Boston Fire Department and the Boston Public Works Department road sanding crew, along with various taxis. Drivers were often encouraged to honk by the protesters. Protesters gave pamphlets and leaflets to cars, pedestrians, and police officers. According to the free daily BostonNOW, Rev. Gerard Renna of the Boston church referred to Anonymous as \"a group of cyber-terrorists ... perpetrating religious hate crimes.\" It is estimated that 200-250 people attended in total. Correspondent: Brian McNeil The Brussels protest organisers decided to take things one step further than the \"mask\" dress code - and introduce a formal dress code of \"Black, and Red Tie\". Saturday saw the start of press coverage for the event with Dutch-language national paper De Morgen devoting four columns in their reporter section to the protest and events that led up to it. Lisa McPherson, Tom Cruise, and John Sweeney were all covered along with images of the \"Anonymous\" advertising poster and the European Church of Scientology HQ in the Brussels city centre. The protesters met up at Parc Royal metro station about 1 km away from the European H.Q. of the Church of Scientology and spent approximately an hour putting finishing touches to placards and cutting up leaflets, all under the watchful eye of a number of suspected Scientology \"spies\" equipped with cameras and cellphones. Following closely the advice from police the group of approximately 30 marched to 91 Wetstraat where the Church H.Q. is in a subdued manner with banners and placards turned down. As the group marched to their point where a static protest was permitted three film crews from Belgian TV ran round filming the group and walking backwards to interview those who were prepared to speak to the press. Protesters came from as far afield as Luxembourg. The police presence for the protest was fairly light, upon arrival at the protest site, 91 Wetstraat (Rue De La Loi) one van and three officers were parked outside the Scientology HQ, approximately 15 minutes later two other police cars had turned up - delivering the Brussels Central chief of police and another four officers to monitor the protest. Instructions were given to protesters that they could not, under Belgian law, conceal their faces with masks, scarves or veils. The signs in use by the protesters included a large \"HONK!\" which whenever a passing motorist hit the horn roused a large cheer from the crowd. Others read \"Scientology kills\", \"Religion is free, Scientology is not\", \"XENU.NET\", \"All your Thetans are belong to us\", \"Hello Scientology, We are Anonymous\", and \"Alien souls inhabit you\". Some were crudely done handwriting, others had been made at the pre-protest meeting with stencils and spray paint. A chant was started early on, and repeated a few times throughout the day, \"Brainwash! Brainwash! Brainwash!\", this could likely be heard by people within the Church H.Q. as a number of upper floor windows were open. Leaflets were handed out to passers by and motorists as they stopped at the nearest set of traffic lights. While highlighting that Christianity, Judaism, and Islam will freely give you details about their religion Scientology was starkly contrasted as \"Ask a Scientologist about their texts, You will be answered. After your check clears\". The protest went off with no problems, although concern was expressed by some participants that they were not better allowed to conceal their identities. This was made extra concerning with the belief that some of those taking photos from a distance were members of the Church cataloguing the protesters. Correspondent: DragonFire1024 As many as 50 people turned up to protest the Church in cold weather and wind driven snow. With temperatures ranging from 10 to just 15 degrees Fahrenheit and winds at nearly 45 miles an hour, protesters held signs and braved Mother Nature. Some lost their signs in the wind a few times, but managed to swipe them back up before they got lost in the weather. Among the protesters attending was Chuck Beatty, a former Scientologist of 27 years from the Sea Org in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. Several passing cars showed their support by honking, including a big red semi-truck tow truck. The police were on scene to make sure protesters followed laws, but they were off duty officers hired by the Church because they \"needed protection from Anonymous,\" said O. Casillas of the Buffalo police Department. Casillas also stated that protesters, \"according to New York state law\", had to be at least 100 feet from the Church, but because of a fence, protesters were allowed to picket across the street from the Church. Casillas also took a flier with the rules and regulations for protesters stating, \"I cannot take sides here, but the Church privately hired us.\" At least three members of the Church were seen photographing, videotaping, and counting anyone who was gathered outside the Church. The protesters were not approached by any members of the Church. Wikinews attempted to get a statement from the church, but Casillas stated that \"the Church knew what organization [I] was from\" and that \"Wikinews was not welcome there [at the Church].\" Wikinews recently published several stories and interviews that do not favor the Church and the officer's quotes suggest the Church is aware of those articles. See a gallery of images below, and or click on the 'Buffalo Photo Gallery' to see all the images. The Chicago protest against the Church began slightly before 11:00 a.m. (central time) and concluded at roughly 4:30 p.m.. Upwards of 70 protesters gathered in support of the protest. Though temperatures remained in the sub-zero range throughout the day (0 degrees Fahrenheit, -22 wind chill), spirits remained high. Participants handed out literature and held signs at the intersection of Lincoln, Wellington and Southport until roughly 2:00 p.m.. During that time, a nearby Catholic church dismissed, and numerous Church-goers welcomed the fliers. Protesters garnered a multitude of honks from supportive motorists. After 2:00 p.m., the large group splintered into multiple travelling squads which navigated the Lakeview and Lincoln Park neighbourhoods until 4:30 p.m.. Protesters had to follow legal restrictions and the Church conducted the Centre's counter-protest measures, such as blocking their windows and holding service from 11:00 a.m. straight through 6:00 p.m.. Approximately 200 people protested Scientology along Cleveland Street in Clearwater.  They were photographed by 20-year-old Scientologist David Pendery, who seemed to believe that it was \"unlawful to wear a mask and I wanted to document it.\"  The Church also hired ten police officers to monitor the protest. The protest was delayed by 30 minutes so the protesters would not interrupt a Presbyterian Church service. [4] More than 100 people picketed on a street corner in front of the Dallas Church of Scientology. Protestors held up signs with pictures of Lisa McPherson, who was a Dallas native. \"We want people to know we are raising awareness, and that is one of our main tools to fight Scientology,\" said one masked protestor. A few signs read \"Honk if you hate Scientology\", and some cars could be heard honking their horns as they passed by. Police were on the scene to ensure that the demonstration was peaceful. The Dallas Church of Scientology released a statement regarding the group Anonymous, which read, \"Using Scientology's prominence, Anonymous hopes to garner more attention ... Religious bigotry of any nature is deplorable and profoundly affects the entire community.\" Video from the event Around 50 to 140 people turned up at the Church of Scientology centre in Edinburgh to protest. As protesters were not allowed directly opposite the centre a small police presence was visible in order to control the crowd. Banners with \"Scientology Kills\" were placed at the front of the protesters and chants gradually began to start as the day progressed. Leaflets were handed out to members of the public passing by while people within the Church of Scientology were seen to be taking photographs from inside the church. Access to the church was restricted during the protest, but several protesters made comment to a reporter from the Scotsman newspaper. The Houston protest hosted an estimated 81 people.   Between 8 and 12 Houston police officers and staff were on site though, but stood and watched the protesters. There were no reports of significant confrontation, though scientologists and protesters took photographs of each other. A CW 39 cameraman was on site taking footage and conducting interviews.  Broadcast television reports of the protest were carried on KHOU CBS 11 and KHCW CW 39 later in the evening. Correspondents: Skenmy and Adambro The first London protest took place outside the Church of Scientology HQ in Queen Victoria Street. Upon arrival at 10:30, approximately 50 people were in attendance. This was complemented by a small team of police officers. Members of the Church of Scientology were handing out flyers outside the HQ, with the protesters on the other side of the road. Numerous members of the media, as well as tens of amateur photographers and videographers were in attendance. By 11:00, the number of protesters had grown to between 300 and 500. A variety of signs were on display, bearing such slogans as \"Ron is Gone but the Con goes On\" (referring to L. Ron Hubbard, founder of Scientology) and \"$cientology Kills\" (referring to the claims that the Church of Scientology extorts money from its members). The police responded to this growth in numbers with riot vans, a large number of Community Support officers, and Police Horses, as well as a dog unit. The protest at Queen Victoria Street was peaceful. Members of Anonymous were respectful of Police orders. Inside the building, security officers could be seen. Members were seen videoing and photographing the protests from the upper windows of the HQ building, prompting responses from the crowd. Signs were held saying \"Honk if you hate Scientology\" - causing a cheer from the crowd every time a car used the horn. The infamous bright yellow \"/b/\" van was seen driving past early in the protest. At around 1:00 the protesters moved on towards Tottenham Court Road's \"Dianetics and Scientology Life Improvement Centre\", where the police presence was even higher, and crowd barriers were set up. Half of Tottenham Court Road was closed for the demonstration, so a single-file line of traffic was all that flowed between the protesters (of which a significant majority of the original number turned up) and the Church of Scientology building. Members of the Church of Scientology were handing out flyers, much like at Queen Victoria Street. However, the crowd this time shouted for passers-by to \"tear it up\" - some of whom did. Police reacted to those tearing up the material and throwing it down with the issue of a littering ticket. This road was much busier than the previous one, and a large crowd gathered to look. The crowd could be heard shouting \"It's a trap!\" when members of the public were offered free Stress Tests by the members of the Church of Scientology. There were a number of minor incidents involving protesters (who were quickly distanced by the majority crowd), but no major violations took place. Estimates by Anonymous for the total numbers at the event range from 300 to 800 people, however the BBC and City of London Police report 200 people at the event. Correspondent: IlyaHaykinson At least 250 people attended the anti-Scientology protest in Los Angeles, California.  The protesters gathered in the morning at a central location and proceeded by subway to the site of the first protest, the Church of Scientology - Los Angeles.  For nearly two hours the protesters chanted \"We are Anonymous\" and other slogans, and responded with yells and upheaval to honking cars that were passing by.   The protest spread over two city blocks, and at one point the entire group of protesters circled the city block containing various Scientology buildings. The protest then proceeded via subway to the Church of Scientology International building in Hollywood.  There the protesters continued chanting, and marched up and down the street.  A group of protesters unfurled a banner in sympathy with the death of Lisa McPherson, and the crowd sang the happy birthday song for her. The protest continued for an additional couple of hours as the crowd moved to a former Scientology recruiting building and then to the street level of a major mall and tourist attraction, Hollywood & Highland. After losing quite a few members the protest moved on to the front of the CNN building in hope of getting on news. Security was high at all Scientology installations, with security officers blocking all entrances to Church buildings, patrolling on foot and bicycle, and most taking pictures or videos of protesters (or even the Wikinews reporter).  No police intervention was observed, though at least one or two officers were present at most times. Correspondent: Fallen-Griever A protest in Manchester took place outside the Church of Scientology centre located on Deansgate, with around 100 people protesting at its peak. The protest was peaceful, with the protesters mainly sticking to waving banners and handing out flyers to passers-by. Protesters respected a request from the police that they should leave the area by 3pm in order to avoid blocking the area for patrons leaving the multiple bars along Deansgate at the end of the Manchester Derby (a football match between Manchester United and Manchester City). There was a minimal police presence at the event and the Church of Scientology centre was closed by the end of the protest. In a video posted on YouTube, at least 75 to 100 protesters can be heard chanting \"Xenu, Xenu, Xenu\" as they protest across the street from the Church. Cars driving by honk their horns in support of the protesters. Police can be seen parked in front of the Church. Correspondent(s): Observer Updates as of 11:54 AM Correspondent(s): Observer In temperatures ranging from 0F to -4F, without windchill, several members of Anonymous showed up. The group ranged from 10 to 25+, with public response mostly positive. The Scientology protest in New Orleans took place at 11:00am CST. There were 19 members of Anonymous that showed up to protest. Everything went smoothly. One police officer stopped by just to make sure that the crowd was demonstrating peacefully. Many pictures and video was taken by the assembled group as well as pictures being taken by the few Scientologists that showed up. One large woman drove incredibly fast to park behind the Scientology building at one point (the church was closed before some protesters arrived) and nearly hit two protesters. She was later spotted snapping countless pictures from the second floor. Over the course of the protests, about 5 cars ended up parked behind the building. One bald man came out to attempt to harass some protesters and was labeled a \"Level 12 Paladin\". He left soon after. Eventually the two most interesting subjects of the Church of Scientology appeared, and were initially perceived as standard passerby's. When offered fliers the couple spat \"What have you done?\" and \"What are your crimes?\" at the protesters. One donned a Scientology vest and stood in front of the building, while his minion walked around taking pictures 5 inches from their faces. There was some sparse foot traffic in the area and handouts were given to people passing by. A woman stopped by to talk to some Anonymous and stated that she had a family member who was trying to leave the CoS and was glad for the protests. A man in a truck parked and got some fliers, promising to return. About an hour later he arrived, wearing sunglasses and armed with a homemade sign, and joined the group. An employee of the local newspaper, The Times Picayune, stopped to speak with Anonymous for a little while. He stated that he was in the area on another story but was interested in finding out information about the protest. The Anonymous answered his questions, gave him handouts, but refused to share any personal contact information with him. Near the end of the protest the two Scientologists decided to walk off. Correspondent(s): David Shankbone An estimated 150 people separated into two primary groups protested the Church of Scientology in Philadelphia. Protests began in the area surrounding City Hall, eventually culminating around the Church located on Race Street. Pedestrian foot traffic was high due to a major event at the Convention Center. A police officer on the scene described the gathering as \"the friendliest [protesters] I've ever seen.\" Correspondent: Bjweeks Approximately 60 people showed up to protest in front of the Scientology church in Phoenix, many wearing purple latex gloves and dressed in black suits. Three Phoenix Police Department officers were present to keep control. CBS 5, Fox 10, NBC 12, The Arizona Republic and The East Valley Tribune came to interview the protesters and  The Church of Scientology held a press conference where the official press release was read and no comments were made about the Phoenix protest. The protesters read high level Scientology teaching that had been made public to Scientologists during the press conference and later in the day, with little visible success. Correspondent: Dar-Ape Several dozen protesters arrived across the street from the Scientology bookstore in South Side to protest, carrying signs and handing out flyers.  Protesters included many students, mostly hailing from Pitt and CMU.  Cars honked in support, though pedestrian traffic was a bit more sparse.  Two or three police officers kept an eye on protesters from inside the bookstore, but everything went smoothly. As the high for the day was twenty degrees and with wind chill making it feel as though the temperatures were in the sub zeros; the anons cut their protest to only about four hours. One Pittsburgh Anon's Photos Images were emailed to Wikinews. The protest in Portland seemed to have had a leader (or leader-like figure) or two, and was lawful and very well organized. There was always yelling, sometimes intense, whenever someone entered the church. Some who entered did so smiling defiantly, some were hesitant and looked noticeably distressed. Loud cheering erupted every time a passing by car honked (estimated 1 out of 5), this included even a Trimet bus. 8 people showed up and picketed in front of City Hall on the 2/10/2008. The reason why City Hall and not the traditional Church of Scientology is because San Antonio does not have a Scientology chapter. This being the reason many of the protesters of San Antonio went to Austin to support their cause . The protesters handed out fliers and held up informational posters and a \"honk if you hate Scientology\" poster. Many of the cars honked including but not limited to the Via bus system, SAPD, SAFD, and churchgoers. San Antonio Videos: [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] San Diego drew about 80 protesters, starting an hour later than most of the other worldwide protests. The group started at the Horton Plaza shopping mall, and then moved on to the Church of Scientology building. After demonstrating there, the group moved back to the shopping mall, positioning itself on eight street corners, handing out information, flyers, and speaking with concerned bystanders. Not one, but two protesters dressed up as Xenu. When 10 News showed up to cover the event, they refused to do an interview unless they could speak with a protester face to face. When none of the protesters agreed to this condition, a compromise was reached. A protester gave an audio interview for the station to use when putting together information about the protest. After several protesters left, the protest moved back to the Church. Police presence was constant, but at the time of dispersal at the end of the protest several members reported being followed by Scientologists. San Diego Videos: More pics A worldwide day of protests against the Church of Scientology has begun in Sydney after an agglomeration of protesters at 11am in Hyde Park. A crowd of about 200 turned out to protest against the Church and its alleged violations of human rights. The group Anonymous, who organized the rally, were handing out fliers to passers-by, and led various anti-Scientology chants by the crowd. The principal allegations made at the rally towards Scientology were the lack of freedom within the Church, and the excessive cost of their courses, which they believe doesn't warrant tax-exempt status. The Protest lasted until 1pm at the Church of Scientology Office in Town Hall and from there partially disbanded. The remaining protesters proceeded to the Scientology office in Broadway and started a lesser secondary protest lasting about 25 minutes. The Toronto protest kicked off at 11:30 a.m. (EST). At least 300 attended the protest for the afternoon. Despite the wind chill of -22 at 11:00 and declining temperatures throughout the day, the protest was still robust at 2:00. The crowd later tapered down to fewer than 10 by 6:00 p.m.. One protester possessed a cap gun, however other protesters in his vicinity quickly pointed him out to the police, who confiscated it without charge. A Church member was seen throwing rock salt at some protesters for a short period of time, but later went back into the Church. Generally, the protest was peaceful and picketers were well behaved overall. Police allowed protesters to stand right outside the Scientology building. There were many people attempting to record the event with cameras, video cameras, and/or microphones, and several picketers were interviewed. The chants sometimes included \"Xenu!\", which left some passersby confused about whether the protest was for or against Scientology. However, the public was generally receptive to the protesters' message, particularly earlier in the day. Many cars passing by, especially taxis, honked in support, as did a fire truck and an ambulance. Most people offered flyers during the first couple of hours took them, though later on people seemed to grow tired of them. It was an enthusiastic, successful protest. Over 200 people showed up and passed out pamphlets, chanted slogans, and covered the entire block at one point. Scientologists tried to counter-protest by unfurling a \"Scientology For Peace\" banner at one point, but protesters with signs blocked the banner from view. After 30 minutes, the Church took down their banner. People from all over the area came to support the protest. Vancouver Police sent a single cruiser on scene to monitor the situation, but after an hour it left without incident. Another moment that should be noted is how after the crowd of protesters swelled from 20-200 participants within an hour, A van pulled up in the rear of the building where no protester was then present. Some people took notice and went down to investigate. What they saw was a number of church members piling boxes of documents and entire filing cabinets into the van. They then soon drove off with it. There were pictures taken of the van. It was as if they anticipated a break-in to their office where demonstrators could've seize documentation. Church members, some in plain clothes and some wearing Church uniforms, videotaped protesters, tried to mingle with the protesters to disrupt the protest from within, and followed protesters away from the protest when they left. About 20 people protested in front of the Scientology Center in Capistrangasse in Vienna's 6th district. At 12:30, half an hour after the demonstration started, individuals claiming to be At least 30 people showed up to protest the Church in Winnipeg. The temperature in Winnipeg on February 10 was -50 C with the wind chill. Project Chanology states that people held signs stating, \"Scientology destroys families, Why is [Lisa McPherson] dead?\" and even \"Honk if you think Scientology is a cult.\" Correspondents:Anonymous101 Although there was no official protest on the internet, thousands of people supported Anonymous by subscribing to the channel on the online video sharing site YouTube, where the numbers for the channel have doubled in 24 hours, making it the most subscribed channel on YouTube this month. However, there have also been a few comments against the protests and \"Anonymous\" in the comments section of the channel. The protests were not confined to the above locations, however. Below is a selection of stories from other protests around the world. \n",

      " Hurricane Fiona batters parts of Caribbean. This week parts of the Caribbean were affected by Hurricane Fiona, a Category 4 hurricane. Large-scale damage to critical water and power infrastructure has been sustained with winds raging as high as 130 miles (209 km) per hour, and later reports of heavy rainfall and flash flooding. The main affected area was Puerto Rico, where at least four people have died and 80% of the island remained without power. An estimated 1.3 million homes and businesses in were left without electricity. One death was reported in Guadeloupe and two deaths were reported in the Dominican Republic, where President Luis Abinader declared three eastern provinces as disaster zones. It was claimed by a resident that La Altagracia Province had been hit much harder than it was by Hurricane Maria in 2017. Fiona then hit the Turks and Caicos Islands, where deputy governor Anya Williams reported widespread power outages, before the hurricane continued north towards Bermuda. On Tuesday, the Federal Emergency Management Agency sent a team to Puerto Rico to assess the damage, as supported by Governor Pedro Pierluisi. \n",

Temperatures are expected to fall to the low 60s across the area, and may reach the lower 50s for inland areas. There is some speculation that the low pressure area associated with the front may draw a yet-to-be-formed tropical storm in from the gulf with little to no warning, as happened with Hurricane Alicia in 1983.  Experts say there is no specific reason to believe this will happen, but plan to monitor the situation. \n",

      " Drought conditions hit much of US again in 2012. Over half of the contiguous United States is experiencing drought conditions, according to a report released Thursday by the National Weather Service. The report, addressing the period through this coming September, predicted many states will see these conditions persist, or worsen. Further government reports indicate that high temperatures have played a role in the drought. Additionally, food supplies are being negatively impacted. 22 percent of the corn and soybean crop in key states is reported in \"poor or very poor condition\"; other crops have also been reduced in the wake of the conditions. Only days ago, over one million residences in the greater Washington D.C. area were without air-conditioning following a rash of storms and high winds. Reports indicate that temperatures reached at least 100 degrees Fahrenheit (about 38C) during that period. Overall, 18 deaths were attributed to those conditions which extended to several states. Two Tennessee brothers, ages 3 and 5 died after playing outside, according to one report. When asked about weather conditions, a Texas woman told Wikinews, \"This heat has been dreadful. I can hardly stand to be outside for more than 10 minutes.\" The National Weather Service's report noted that, in the southeastern US, some weather improvements are expected across certain portions of Georgia and South Carolina. An Arkansas woman told Wikinews, \"...it's horrible. We're not used to these kinds of temperatures. It's so miserable outside right now. It doesn't normally get this hot here...this is unbelievable.\" Sources are referring to this drought as the worst since 1988. \n",

      " Fires burn across eastern Australia amid summer heatwave. Despite earlier cooler weather, heatwave conditions are expected to resume in New South Wales, Australia. Local weather service forecasts expect temperatures to rise above 40°C (104°F), as-experienced earlier in the week. The percentage of uncontained fires jumped as high as 20%. On Friday, local fire authorities have declared total fire bans across Victoria, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory. Fire crews at the east coast of Australia are readying to battle an increased rate of bushfires during the weekend. Uncontrolled fires have also been burning across the states of Tasmania, Victoria, and Queensland. Extremely hot weather and strong winds played havoc with the fires early in the week. A minor change in the weather assisted crews on Thursday but the high temperatures are set to return on Friday and through the weekend. Thirty devastating fires in Tasmania are now being controlled after burning 130 properties and 110,000 hectares of land throughout the past week. In Victoria there are two significant fires being fought with several others now under control but concerns remain for the weekend with the temperature forecast to rise to 42°C in the north of the state. Queensland firefighters continued to battle fires north of of the capital Brisbane on Bribie Island, with at least 22 fires still burning throughout the state. New South Wales has 120 fires burning as of Friday with 370,000 hectares of land, 10,000 livestock and one property already destroyed. Deputy Commissioner of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service, Rob Rogers briefed reporters on the bushfires at the Rural Fire Service Headquarters on Friday. \"They are very large, all either in excess or very close to 10,000 hectares (and) in some cases 100 kilometres of fireline. One fire at Dean's Gap in New South Wales had authorities concerned due to its proximity to an old military range that contains unexploded ordinances at Tianjara plateau. Firefighters have used earth moving equipment to create containment lines and specialised gel to protect the range. \n",

      " England: Multi-storey carpark in Liverpool gutted by fire, 1,300 vehicles destroyed. A fire on Sunday night in the seven-storey carpark for the Echo Arena in Liverpool, England destroyed almost all the vehicles parked inside and led to cancellation of the final evening of the Liverpool International Horse Show and evacuation of nearby blocks of flats. The blaze reportedly started with a parked Range Rover Discovery. Investigators with the fire brigade stated that they believe the fire began with an accidental engine fire in the Range Rover at about 4.30 pm. The first call was made at 4.42 and firefighters arrived eight minutes after that. Ultimately twelve engines and 85 firefighters were involved in combatting the blaze. Aerial appliances were used and also three high-volume pumps. Fed by the fuel in vehicles parked inside, the temperature of the fire in the carpark is believed to have reached as high as 1,000°C. It was too hot to be extinguished with water from hydrants, so a high-volume pump was used to draw water from the River Mersey, and two more were brought from other fire brigades in the region. The carpark has seven storeys and a capacity of 1,600 vehicles, and approximately 1,300  were parked in it when the fire broke out. According to Dan Stephens, chief fire officer for Merseyside Fire and Rescue Service, almost all of them were destroyed, with the exception of a few parked on the top level and at corners. \"With these very high temperatures, you were never going to put the fire out without the whole building taking hold. The speed at which the fire spreads means you simply aren’t going to put it out,\" said Stephens. The carpark itself was severely damaged; according to Joe Anderson, the mayor of Liverpool. It is not in danger of collapsing but will have to be demolished, which will be difficult with the many burned-out cars still inside it, Anderson told the BBC. According to Stephens, there were no serious injuries: one woman injured her hand, and two people were treated for smoke inhalation. A spokesman for the Echo Arena also stated that all animals were safe. All horses were successfully evacuated from the carpark and then removed from the stables after smoke spread to them. Six dogs were also rescued unharmed, two on a lower level in the early stages of the fire and four that had been left in a car on the top level, freed by firefighters on Monday after the fire was put out. The final evening of the four-day Liverpool International Horse Show had been scheduled to begin at 7.30, and had to be cancelled. Many attendees were stranded in the city on New Year's Eve night. Merseyside police directed people to the Pullman Hotel, where Red Cross assistance was available, and the Liverpool City Council set up an assistance centre at the Lifestyles Gym. A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers has said that insurance companies will \"move very quickly\" to reimburse owners whose vehicles were destroyed. Nearby blocks of flats were evacuated because of the smoke. Eyewitnesses reported hearing what they at first thought were firecrackers, then \"multiple explosions\", \"bangs and popping\", \"the bangs of car windows exploding\". People reported leaving everything in their cars, including their cellphones, and running for their lives. Mayor Anderson tweeted that cuts to fire services over the last two years made it significantly harder to fight the fire and might have caused it not to be controllable. He also suggested that fire safety in multi-storey carparks had not been sufficiently considered and that installing sprinklers in them might help stop future fires before they become unmanageable, in a letter to Nick Hurd, a member of Parliament. \n",

      " Warmest global winter on record according to NOAA. Although the United States experienced average temperatures for the December, 2006 to February, 2007 period, overall world temperatures were the warmest on record, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). In a March 15, 2007 report, the NOAA indicated that a record warm January helped push the combined global land and ocean surface temperature for the past winter to its highest value since records began in 1880. The ocean-atmosphere system, El Niño, played a part in the season’s record warmth, according to the report's authors, but its effects did not last long, as ocean temperatures in the central equatorial Pacific cooled more than 0.3 degrees C in February and were near average for the month. The global land-surface temperature was the warmest on record, while the ocean-surface temperature tied for second warmest in the past 128 year period, approximately 0.06 degrees C cooler than the record established during the strong El Niño episode of 1997-1998. During the past century, global surface temperatures have increased approximately 0.06 degrees C per decade, but since 1976 the rate of increase has been about 0.18 degrees C per decade. The greatest temperature increase occurred in the high latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. In an interview with Reuters, Jay Lawrimore of NOAA suggested that the data does not show greenhouse gases had an influence on the recent temperature increases, but acknowledges that by \"looking at long-term trends and long-term changes, we are able to better understand natural and anthropogenic (human-caused) climate change.\" A U.S. Commerce Department agency based in Washington, D.C., the NOAA conducts research and gathers data on oceans and atmosphere. The NOAA is a participant in the Group on Earth Observations, GEO, an intergovernmental effort to coordinate the collection of Earth observations worldwide. \n",

      " Heat wave proves deadly for Nebraska cattle. Over 2,000 cattle died throughout eight counties in Nebraska last week as a result of an unexpected heat wave. Officials estimate that number could grow as other counties report in. According to Tim Reimer of the United States Farm Service Agency, cattle nearing slaughter are difficult to keep cool due to their large size, and thus more vulnerable to heat. The animals are provided large quantities of water, but they sometimes stop drinking under the effects of the high temperatures. The deaths worsened the situation for farmers, who were already struggling with high feed costs. \"There were some that took some pretty substantial hits financially\", Reimer said. Temperatures in eastern portions of the state soared into the mid 90s. The heat wave was preceded by an unusually cool spring, so the animals didn't have a chance to acclimatise. Terry Mader, a professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, reported that \"Cattle, as well as other animals and humans, usually need two to four weeks to adapt to the changes in environmental conditions we observed last week. Sunny days with temperatures above the mid-80s can be stressful, particularly if there is no wind and humidity is above 50%.\" Similar heat waves occurred during the 1990s, when thousands of cattle were lost. Mader noted, \"There's no opportunity for them to get prepared [...] Normally, you'll have one to two days in a heat wave to get prepared.\" Mature cattle are generally worth US$1,000 apiece. \n",

      " Australia's Simpson Desert to be closed for summer. South Australia's Department of Environment and Heritage has announced that the Simpson Desert in Central Australia will close annually from December 15 through to March 1. The department says a risk assessment showed temperatures of 40 to 50ºC (104 to 122ºF) were dangerous for people crossing the desert. The closure will affect the Simpson Desert Conservation Park and Simpson Desert Regional Reserve, an area of approximately 3.6 million hectares (8.9 million acres). Trevor Naismith, regional operations director of the department, said the closure was necessary to prevent deaths and ensure the health and safety of visitors and emergency staff. “Closing the desert is really a common sense thing to prevent deaths of unsuspecting visitors,” Mr Naismith said. \"We’re very keen to encourage safe and responsible use of the desert; however we do have a duty of care.\" \"It’s just such a vast and inhospitable place during summer, there are no trees and there is no shade and it’s so hot, it really is one of the most inhospitable places in Australia if not in the world.\" \"There's been a number of near misses and we have had deaths in past years in the northern parts of South Australia in relation to overseas tourists who are not experienced and are ill-prepared for the conditions.\" The department says that high temperatures can have a severe effect on the body, with heat exhaustion leading to loss of proper body function and ultimately death. High temperatures can also cause vehicles to overheat, vaporise fuel, blow tires and for batteries to fail. Local tourism outlets and visitor information centres have been advised of the closure and new information signs will be installed at all entrances to the park. It is not believed that the closure will have a large effect on local tourism businesses as only around 25 vehicles cross the desert through summer. People caught by park rangers crossing the desert will face fines of up to A$1,000. \n",
