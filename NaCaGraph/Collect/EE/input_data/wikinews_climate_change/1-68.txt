Wikinews interviews Christoph Bals of the NGO Germanwatch after conclusion of climate conference. With the Climate Conference in Bali having come to a successful conclusion, Wikinews journalist Sean Heron interviewed Christoph Bals from the German NGO Germanwatch on his opinion of the outcome, and an outlook on the future negotiations. Christoph is the Senior Political Executive of Germanwatch, Co-Author of the Climate protection-Index and did lobby work on Bali. Wikinews: Could you explain what defines the organization Germanwatch and what your targets are? WN: Could you go into more specifics on what it is you do on climate change? WN: The next question, which is very much at hand, is of course how Germanwatch views the outcome of the negotiations? Have your expectations been fulfilled? WN: Would you have expected this outcome yesterday? Or a year ago? WN: How do things continue after this conference? What's the course of events until the Conference in Copenhagen, Denmark 2009? WN: What needs to happen in this period of time in your opinion? What do the agreements that are hopefully to be reached need to look like? WN: What do you see as (the biggest) obstacle(s) on the way to such an agreement? You've already mentioned the current U.S. administration. WN: Finally I, and perhaps the readers as well, are interested in how people at home can take a positive influence on the process? WN: Does that mean the demand for a climate compatible life style? WN: Thank you for the interview and your time.
