Blair wishes to cooperate with the United States to reduce climatic change. Mr Byers said yesterday: "The reality is that unless we can get the United States engaged - responsible as it is for around a quarter of the world's carbon dioxide emissions - then any hopes of successfully tackling global warming will be doomed to failure. Some sources are saying, Blair is saying these things because he can make the more progressive voters change their mind, so they would vote for him.
