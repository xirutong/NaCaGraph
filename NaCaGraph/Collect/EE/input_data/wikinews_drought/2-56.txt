After the match, she said in an interview, "I am 30 years old and I thought it would be like going down, my performance, but I was shocked I was able to do it". A statement from the Philippines' presidential spokesman Harry Roque celebrated Diaz's win, saying, "Congratulations, Hidilyn. The entire Filipino nation is proud of you". The previous record-setter Liao Qiuyun of China took the silver medal with a total weight of 223 kg (492 lb), and Zulfiya Chinshanlo of Kazakhstan took the bronze with 213 kg (470 lb).
