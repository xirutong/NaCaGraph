2008 Winter Carnival partially thaws in Saint Paul. The Saint Paul Winter Carnival in Saint Paul, Minnesota suffered a brief thaw on Monday, with Monday's 41Â°F afternoon temperature plummeting below zero twenty four hours later.  On Sunday, judging of both ice and snow sculptures had taken place.  By Monday afternoon, temperatures above freezing had greatly damaged the outdoor sculptures.  In Rice Park, fallen ice from sculptures mixed with chunks left from the previous day's carving.  Snow sculptures at the State Fairgrounds were also significantly damaged. The brief warmth made for comfortable skating on the Wells Fargo Winterskate rink next to Landmark Center in downtown Saint Paul.  A block away the Hot Dish Tent was offering popular high-starch fare. The Winter Carnival started in 1886, after the city's Chamber of Commerce took offense at a New York reporter's comparison of the city to Siberia.  The annual event celebrates the cold weather while drawing people to outdoor and indoor activities.
