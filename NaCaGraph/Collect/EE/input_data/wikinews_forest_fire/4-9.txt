Iberia burning: forest fires rage across Portugal. In Portugal, which is suffering its worst drought since 1945, some 1,500 firefighters and 600 soldiers battled forest fires that have raged for six days. They said cooler temperatures and higher air humidity levels helped them to contain more than a dozen fires but the risk of new ones remained high.
