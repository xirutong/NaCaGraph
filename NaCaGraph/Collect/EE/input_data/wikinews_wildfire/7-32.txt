Texas cold weather creates major highway closures. On Friday, an uncommon cold weather system which dipped far into southern Texas created major transportation problems for sections of the state. The major cold weather system stretched from central Texas, eastward to Houston and southward to Galveston, a gulf region not accustomed to such cold snaps. Nearly all sections of Interstate Highway-35 from San Antonio to Austin, a span of about 75 miles, were closed on Friday morning. Traffic was moving at approximately 5 miles per hour around mid-day on adjacent access roads. A Texas man told Wikinews it took him about three times longer-than-usual to drive from San Antonio to Austin due to weather condition and the closed highway. Schools in Houston closed Thursday at 4:00pm and remained closed on Friday. Many businesses in Houston also closed on Friday. Huntsville, a city in the deep part of southeast Texas, received 2 inches of snow.
