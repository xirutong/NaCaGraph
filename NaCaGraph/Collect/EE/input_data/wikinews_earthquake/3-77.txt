Magnitude 7.0 earthquake affects archipelago of Vanuatu. During the day yesterday, a strong earthquake of magnitude 7.0, according to the United States Geological Survey (USGS), was recorded in the Vanuatu islands located in the South Pacific. According to the USGS, the epicenter of this earthquake was centered at 0.6 mile (1  km) southeast of Norsup. The Pacific Tsunami Warning Center (PTWC) preliminarily declared a tsunami alert in the South Pacific, which was later revised by the center. This strong quake did not leave any reported wounded or damage to homes or structures in the area. The islands of Vanuatu are part of the famous "Ring of Fire" and for this reason earthquakes occur frequently of around this magnitude; one was registered early this month with a magnitude of 6.9.
