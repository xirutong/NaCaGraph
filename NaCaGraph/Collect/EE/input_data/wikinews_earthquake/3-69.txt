Strong earthquake in Sumatra. Two earthquakes, measuring 6.3 and 6.0 on the Richter scale struck the Indonesian island of Sumatra within the space of two hours, killing at-least 70 people. The death toll may rise as a large number of buildings were destroyed and the search for survivors continues. No tsunami warning was issued, although some people in coastal areas moved inland.  However, as the quake was under land there was no likelihood of a tsunami. The tremors were felt in Singapore and Malaysia as well.
