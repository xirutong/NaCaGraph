Magnitude 5.4 earthquake hits Southern California. An earthquake occurred on Wednesday evening in Southern California with a magnitude of 5.4. According to the United States Geological Survey, the earthquake occurred at 16:53 local time (2353 UTC). At least two dozen smaller aftershocks, none greater than a magnitude of 3.6, have struck the same area since the quake. The earthquake occurred at a depth of 14 kilometers (8.7 miles), and the epicenter was located 20 kilometers Northwest of Borrego Springs; 23 kilometers Southeast of Anza; 33 kilometers Northeast of Lake Henshaw; and 94 kilometers to the northeast of San Diego. There were no initial reports of any major damage. San Diego skyscrapers are reported to have swayed as a result of the earthquake. Wikinews reporter Mike Morales, who was in the area at the time of the tremor, reported: "I remember it happened around five o'clock. It was nothing much, just a little rolling feeling." According to Kate Hutton of the California Institute of Technology, this earthquake was caused by an earlier quake in April with a magnitude of 7.2. Hutton says that "changes in the fault line" from April's quake, caused today's quake to occur. The April quake was centered in the southern Imperial Valley south of Mexicali, Mexico near the Colorado River.
